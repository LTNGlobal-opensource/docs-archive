Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

By default, when you use the Pipelines for Applications web UI, updating
and rebuilding your deployment manifest are two steps. However, when you
store your manifest in your code repository, you can update the manifest
and trigger an autobuild in a single step. Youâ€™ll also benefit from
centralizing your code and using version control.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications

To store your manifest in your code repository:

1.  Transfer the instructions from your web UI manifest into a new
    `distelli-manifest.yml` file. [Make sure to format it according to
    our
    documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/manifest.md#formatting-the-distelli-manifestyml-file).

2.  Add `distelli-manifest.yml` to your code repository. Read an example
    of how to do this in our documentation: [Bugzilla: Automate install
    and
    setup](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/application-bugzilla.md).

3.  In the web UI, at the top of the **Manifest** page, uncheck **Use
    this manifest for builds and deployments**.

4.  Configure autobuild [using the instructions in our
    documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/build.md#enable-auto-build).

Read more about [`distelli-manifest.yml` in our
documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/manifest.md).

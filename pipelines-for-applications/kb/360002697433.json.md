Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

My application uses a Git repo with submodules. When I build it, I get
errors and have empty submodule directories. How do I use submodules in
my build?

### Error messages and logs

When trying to build an application with submodules, you might end up
with the following issues.

  - Empty submodule directories

  - Build errors that call out missing dependencies

  - Errors such as:
    
        Build:

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications  
**Version:** SaaS: latest, on premises: 2.1.00  
**Installation type:** SaaS or on premises

### Solution

Fetch submodules and make them available in builds using the following
steps.

#### **If you’re using a public build server**

1.  At the top of the **Build** section in your manifest, add the
    following:
    
        git submodule init
        git submodule update

2.  Copy your public SSH key to the Pipelines web UI and your
    submodule’s repository [using the instructions in our
    documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/build-configure.md#ssh-build-keys).

#### **If you’re using your own build server**

**Before you begin:** You need a public and private key pair for the
`distelli` user. If you don’t have one, create one in the directory
`/home/distelli/.ssh` using [instructions from a Bitbucket support
article](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/creating-ssh-keys-776639788.md).

**Note**: We cannot provide support for third party software.

1.  At the top of the **Build** section in your manifest, add the
    following
    
        git submodule init
        git submodule update

2.  On the build server, change to the `distelli` user by running `su -
    distelli`.

3.  Still on the build server, SSH to your Git host, for example: `ssh
    -vT git@github.com`. If your host is not on the list of known hosts,
    you will be prompted to add it.

4.  In your Git host’s user settings, add the public key you created in
    order to provide access to the submodule.

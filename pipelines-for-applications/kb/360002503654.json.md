# KB\#0249 Resolve a "Process Stopping" error when cancelling a hanging Pipelines for Applications deployment

Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

When I try to deploy my application in the Web UI from the **Builds**
page, it hangs and does not finish. I clicked **Abort Deployment**, and
in the deployment log I got the error: `"Process Stopping", Aborting
builds show error`. How do fix the problem and deploy my application?

### Error messages and logs

`"Process Stopping", Aborting builds show error "An Error has Occurred.
Please Contact Support."`

You get this error when the Pipelines agent on the deployment server
crashes or becomes unresponsive.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications  
**Installation type:** SaaS and on premises

### Solution

To fix this issue, restart the Pipelines agent.

1.  SSH into the deployment server as root or a user with sudo
    privileges.

2.  Run `sudo /usr/local/bin/distelli agent start`.

With the issue resolved, try deploying your application again.

Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

When you pull down and build code from your Git host, you get a `FAILED:
git -C` error.

### Error messages

When you pull down and build code from your Git host, you get the
following message:

### Version and installation information

**Pipelines product:** Pipelines for Applications, Pipelines for
Containers  
**Version:** All  
**Installation type:** SaaS, on premises

### Solution

You are getting a Git version error. The `-C` flag, which is used to
pull down your code, was added in Git version 1.8.5. When you use
Pipelines for Applications or Containers as your build server, by
default, a later version of Git is used, which does not have this issue.
When you use your own build server, use version 2.7.4 of Git to avoid
issues.

**Note:** We cannot troubleshoot third-party software.

1.  On your build server, check your Git version by running `git
    --version`.

2.  If you are not using Git version 2.7.4, [upgrade
    Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

To avoid issues, keep the Pipelines agent updated. If you have issues,
you can check the agent's status and gather additional information to
troubleshoot them.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications

### Solution

### Keep the agent up to date

The Pipelines agent is part of the CI/CD pipeline, so it is under rapid
development. If you're having issues with the Pipelines agent, check to
see if there's an updated version of the agent available. If so, update
it.

1.  To check the latest available version of the agent, look at the
    [installation
    script's](https://pipelines.puppet.com/download/client) `VERSION`
    setting.

2.  To check your agent's version, on the node where the agent is
    installed, run `distelli version`.

3.  Update the agent by [downloading and running the
    installer.](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/agent.md#installing-the-pipelines-agent)

### Check the agent's status

There are several ways to check the agent's status.

  - On the node where the agent is installed, you can see whether the
    agent is running or stopped by running `distelli agent status`.
    
    [Read more about the `distelli agent status`
    command](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/agent-command.md#usrlocalbindistelli-agent-status).

  - You can view the agent's processes, deployed applications, and
    current deployments by running `distelli agent dump`
    
    [Read more about the `distelli agent dump`
    command](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/agent-command.md#usrlocalbindistelli-agent-dump).

  - If you can view the status endpoint, the agent is responding to API
    calls. You can also use the the agent's status endpoint to check the
    agent's start time and restart history.
    
    To make a call to the status endpoint:

<!-- end list -->

1.  On the node where the agent is installed, run `distelli agent
    status`. The command returns a URL providing information about the
    agent's server. Navigate to the URL.

2.  On the **Server** page, copy the server URL.

3.  To make a call to the endpoint, edit the server URL:
    
    Change
    
    `<URL>/servers/<SERVER ID NUMBER>`
    
    to
    
    `<URL>/js/server/<SERVER ID NUMBER>/aping`
    
    For example, if the server's URL is:
    
    `https://www.pipelines.puppet.com/exampleuser/servers/d2f4990f-6055-2d4c-adc5-fa163ea427c6`
    
    the status endpoint URL is:
    
    `https://www.pipelines.puppet.com/exampleuser/js/server/d2f4990f-6055-2d4c-adc5-fa163ea427c6/aping`

**Troubleshooting calls to the status endpoint**

If the endpoint returns a 404 error, follow these steps to fix the
issue.

1.  Check that the URL is formatted correctly. Fix it if needed.

2.  If the URL is correct, check that the agent is up and running.
    
    1.  Log into the node where the agent is installed.
    
    2.  Check the agent's status by running `distelli agent status`
    
    3.  If the agent is down, start it by running `distelli agent start`

### Check agent logs and increase the log level

Check agent logs to get more information about agent issues. The logs
for the agent, `agent.log` and `supervise.log`, are in `/distelli/logs`.

If the logs don't have enough information to help you fix your issue,
you can increase the log level from info (default) to debug by running
`distelli agent loglevel debug`

[Read more about the `distelli agent loglevel debug`
command.](https://pipelines.puppet.com/docs/agent/agent-loglevel/)

Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

Iâ€™m getting permissions errors and do not have access to run sudo
commands when I build, restart, terminate, and deploy in Pipelines for
Applications.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications

### Solution

In most cases, the Pipelines agent is installed with sudo. However, if
[you install the agent without
sudo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/agent.md#install-the-agent-non-sudo),
users doing builds, restarts, terminate, and deployment tasks on the
server do not have permissions to run sudo commands or use root
permissions.

To fix the issue, [reinstall the agent with root
permissions](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/agent.md#installing-the-pipelines-agent).

Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

When a build finishes in Pipelines for Applications, no source files are
generated for the release package, and there is nothing available to
deploy.

### Version and installation information

**Product:**Â Pipelines for Applications  
**Installation type:** SaaS, on premises

When using an in-app manifest, the `PkgInclude` section is populated
with a `*`, meaning all source files are added to your release by
default.

However, when using your own `distelli_manifest.yml`, source files are
not added to the release by default. Since no files are included, your
application is not generated during deployment. Resolve the issue by
adding source files to the the `PkgInclude` section of the manifest.

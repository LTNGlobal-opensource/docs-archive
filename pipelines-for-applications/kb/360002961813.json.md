Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

You can change the runtime user for the Pipelines agent before
installing the agent.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications  
**Installation type:** SaaS and on premises

### Solution

The Pipelines agent is in the `/distelli` directory. To change the
runtime user for the Pipelines agent before you install the agent,
change the owner of that folder on the node where you’re installing it.

1.  On the node you are installing the Pipelines agent on, create the
    `/distelli` directory.

2.  Change the owner of the `/distelli` directory to the desired user.

3.  Install the agent [using the steps in our
    documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/pipelines-for-applications/enterprise/agent.md#installing-the-pipelines-agent).

The agent’s runtime will be the user that owns the `/distelli` directory
during installation.

Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

You can output how long a deployment takes in your deployment log by
adding environment variables to your manifest.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications  
**Installation type:** SaaS, on premises

### Solution

Edit your manifest to add environment variables.

1.  In the navigation bar, click **Applications**, click your
    application, then click **Manifest**. Next to **Deployment
    Manifest**, click `+`. In the `PreInstall` section, add the
    following lines to capture the time the deployment started:
    
    ``` 
      PreInstall:
        - START=$(date +%s)
        - echo "$START" > "$DISTELLI_TMP_FILENAME"
    ```

2.  Still in the **Deployment manifest**, add the following lines to the
    `PostStart:` section to capture the time deployment completed and
    the length of time that the deployment took, and output the length
    of time:
    
    ``` 
      PostStart:
        - START=$(cat $DISTELLI_TMP_FILENAME)
        - rm "$DISTELLI_TMP_FILENAME"
        - END=$(date +%s)
        - echo $((END-START)) | awk '{printf " This deployment took %02d minutes and %02d seconds\n",int($1/60), int($1%60)}'
    ```

3.  After your deployment completes, in the navigation bar, click
    **Applications**, click your application, then click your
    deployment. On the deployment page, under **Deployment Servers**,
    select **Log**. Ensure that **Deployment Logs** is selected.
    
    In the log, you will see a message showing how long the deployment
    took, for example:
    
    `This deployment took 5 minutes and 23 seconds.`

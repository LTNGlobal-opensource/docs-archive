Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

In **App History**, a new commit or pull request is showing, but my
application is not building.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Applications  
**Installation type:** SaaS or on premises

### Solution

You might see this issue when you are building an application from a
forked repository. To fix the issue, confirm that Pipelines for
Applications is configured to allow builds from a forked repository.

1.  On the page for your application, click **Application Settings**

2.  Next to **General and Security**, click `+`.

3.  Ensure that **Allow pull requests from forked repositories (warning:
    this may allow forked repository owners to run malicious code)** is
    checked. If you change the setting, save it by clicking **Update
    Settings**.

You should now be able to build your application.

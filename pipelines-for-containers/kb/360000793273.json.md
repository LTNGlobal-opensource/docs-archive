Puppet Pipelines reached end of life on 2020-01-31. 

If Pipelines for Containers deployment fails before pods start in
Kubernetes, fix the issue by editing your manifest.

### Version and installation information

**Product:** Pipelines for Containers

**Installation type:** SaaS, on premises

### Solution

For deployment to succeed, pods must be started in Kubernetes before
deployment begins in Pipelines for Containers.

Delay deployment until after the pods are started by setting an
appropriate value for `minReadySeconds` in your manifest. For example,
if you expect it to take 30 seconds for the pods to start, set
`minReadySeconds` to more than 30.

Here's an example manifest that sets the value of `minReadySeconds`:

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: k8s-mysql
      spec:
        revisionHistoryLimit: 3
        minReadySeconds: 10
        strategy:
          type: RollingUpdate
          rollingUpdate:
            maxUnavailable: 10%
            maxSurge: 10%
        replicas: 1
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: mysql
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: k8s-mysql
              image: doct15/k8s-mysql:134666
              ports:
              - containerPort: 3306
                hostPort: 3306
                protocol: TCP
                name: mysql
              volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /etc/mysql
                name: mysql-etc
              - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
                name: mysql-varlib
            volumes:
            - name: mysql-etc
              emptyDir: {}
            - name: mysql-varlib
              emptyDir: {}

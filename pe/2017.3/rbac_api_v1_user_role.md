# User roles endpoints

By assigning roles to users, you can manage them in sets that are granted access permissions to various PE objects. This makes tracking user access more organized and easier to manage. The `roles` endpoints enable you to get lists of roles and create new roles.

## User role keys

The following keys are used with the RBAC v1 APIâ€™s roles endpoints.

|Key|Explanation|Example|
|---|-----------|-------|
|`id`|An integer identifying the role.|`18`|
|`display_name`|The role's name as a string.|`"Viewers"`|
|`description`|A string describing the role's function.|`"View-only permissions"`|
|`permissions`|An array containing permission objects that indicate what permissions a role grants. An empty array is valid. See Permission keys for more information.|`[]`|
|`user_ids`

`group_ids`

|An array of UUIDs indicating which users and groups are directly assigned to the role. An empty array is valid.|`["fc115750-555a-11e4-916c-0800200c9a66"]`|

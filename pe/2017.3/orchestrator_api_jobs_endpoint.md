# Puppet orchestrator API: jobs endpoint

Use the `/jobs` endpoint to examine orchestrator jobs and their details.

## GET /jobs

### Parameters

The request accepts the following query parameters:

|Parameter|Definition|
|---------|----------|
|`limit`|Return only the most recent *n* number of jobs.|
|`offset`

|Return results offset *n* records into the result set.|
|`order_by`|Return results ordered by a column. Ordering is available on `owner`, `timestamp`, `environment`, `name`, and `state`. Orderings requested on `owner` will be applied to the `login` subfield of `owner`.|
|`order`|Indicates whether results should be returned in ascending or descending order. Valid values are "asc" and "desc". Defaults to "asc"|

For example:

`https://orchestrator.example.com:8143/orchestrator/v1/jobs/352/jobs?limit=20&offset=20`

### Error Responses

See the error response documentation for the general format of error responses. For this endpoint, the `kind` key of the error displays the conflict.

|Key|Definition|
|---|----------|
|`puppetlabs.orchestrator/validation-error`|If the `job-id` in the request is not an integer, the server returns a `400` response.|
|`puppetlabs.orchestrator/unknown-job`|If the job does not exist, the server returns a `404` response.|

## GET /jobs/:job-id/nodes

List all of the nodes associated with a given job.

### Response Format

The response is a JSON object that details the nodes associated with a job.

`next-events` is an object containing information about where to find events about the job. It has the following keys:

|Key|Definition|
|---|----------|
|`id`|The url of the next event.|
|`event`|The next event id.

|

`items`: a list of all the nodes associated with the job, where each node has the following keys:

|Key|Definition|
|---|----------|
|`timestamp`|\(deprecated\) The time of the most recent activity on the node. Prefer `start_timestamp` and `finish_timestamp`.|
|`start_timestamp`|The time the node starting running or `nil` if the node hasn't started running or was skipped.

|
|`finish_timestamp`|The time the node finished running or `nil` if the node hasn't finished running or was skipped.

|
|`duration`|The duration of the puppet run in seconds if the node has finished running, the duration in seconds that has passed since the node started running if it is currently running, or `nil` if the node hasn't started running or was skipped|
|`state`|The current state of the job.|
|`transaction_uuid`|\(deprecated\) The ID used to identify the nodes last report.|
|`name`|The hostname of the node.|
|`details`|information about the last event and state of a given node.|
|`result`|The result of a successful, failed, errored node-run. The schema of this will vary.|

For example:

```json
{
  "next-events": {
    "id": "https://orchestrator.example.com:8143/orchestrator/v1/jobs/3/events?start=10",
    "event": "10"
  },
  "items" : [ {
    "timestamp" : "2015-07-13T20:37:01Z",
    "start_timestamp" : "2015-07-13T20:36:13Z",
    "finish_timestamp" : "2015-07-13T20:37:01Z",
    "duration" : 48.0,
    "state" : "state",
    "transaction_uuid" : :uuid,
    "name" : "wss6c3w9wngpycg.example.com",
    "details" : {
      "message": "Message of latest event"
    },
    "results": {
      "output_1": "success",
      "output_2": [1, 1, 2, 3,]
    }
  },{
  ...
  } ]
}
```

### Results

The result field is available after a node finishes, fails, or errors and contains the contents of the details of the corresponding event. In task jobs this is the result of executing the task. For puppet jobs it should contain metrics from the puppet run.

For example:

An error when running a task:

```
"result" : {
  "msg" : "Running tasks is not supported for agents older than version 5.1.0",
  "kind" : "puppetlabs.orchestrator/execution-failure",
  "details" : {
    "node" : "copper-6"
   }
}
```

Raw stdout from a task:

```
"result" : {
  "output" : "test\n"
}

```

Structured output from a task

```
"result" : {
  "status" : "up to date",
  "version" : "5.0.0.201.g879fc5a-1.el7"
}
```

Error output from a task

```
"result" : {
  "error" : "Invalid task name 'package::status'"
}

```

Puppet run results:

```
"result" : {
  "hash" : "d7ec44e176bb4b2e8a816157ebbae23b065b68cc",
  "noop" : {
    "noop" : false,
    "no_noop" : false
  },
  "status" : "unchanged",
  "metrics" : {
    "corrective_change" : 0,
    "out_of_sync" : 0,
    "restarted" : 0,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "total" : 347,
    "changed" : 0,
    "scheduled" : 0,
    "failed_to_restart" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "environment" : "production",
  "configuration_version" : "1502024081"
}
```

### Details

The details field contains information based on the last event and current state of the node and may be empty. In some cases it may duplicate data from the results key for historical reasons.

If the node state is `finished` or `failed` the details hash may include a message and a report-url. \(deprecated\) for jobs started with the run command it also duplicates some information from the result.

```json
{
  "items" : [ {
    "timestamp" : "2015-07-13T20:37:01Z",
    "state" : "finished",
    "transaction_uuid" : :uuid,
    "name" : "wss6c3w9wngpycg.example.com",
    "details" : {
      "report-url" : "https://peconsole.example.com/#/cm/report/a15bf509dd7c40705e4e1c24d0935e2e8a1591df",
      "message": "Finished puppet run on wss6c3w9wngpycg.example.com - Success!"
    }
    "result" : {
      "metrics" : {
        "total" : 82,
        "failed" : 0,
        "changed" : 51,
        "skipped" : 0,
        "restarted" : 2,
        "scheduled" : 0,
        "out_of_sync" : 51,
        "failed_to_restart" : 0
      },
  },{
  ...
  } ]
}
```

If the node state is `skipped` or `errored`, the service includes a `:detail` key that explains why a node is in that state.

```json
{
  "items" : [ {
    "timestamp" : "2015-07-13T20:37:01Z",
    "state" : "failed",
    "transaction_uuid" : :uuid,
    "name" : "wss6c3w9wngpycg.example.com",
    "details" : {
      "message": "Error running puppet on wss6c3w9wngpycg.example.com: java.net.Exception: Something went wrong"
    }
  },{
  ...
  } ]
}
```

If the node state is `running`, the service returns the `run-time` \(in seconds\).

```json
{
  "items" : [ {
    "timestamp" : "2015-07-13T20:37:01Z",
    "state" : "running",
    "transaction_uuid" : :uuid,
    "name" : "wss6c3w9wngpycg.example.com",
    "details" : {
      "run-time": 30,
      "message": "Started puppet run on wss6c3w9wngpycg.example.com..."
    }
  },{
  ...
  } ]
}
```

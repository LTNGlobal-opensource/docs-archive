# Environment isolation metadata and Code Manager

Both your live and staging code directories contain metadata files that are generated by file sync to provide environment isolation for your resource types.

These files, which have a `.pp` extension, ensure that each environment uses the correct version of the resource type. Do not delete or modify these files. Do not use expressions from these files in regular manifests.

These files are generated as Code Manager deploys new code in your environments. If you are new to Code Manager, these files are generated when you first deploy your environments. If you already use Code Manager, the files will be generated as you make and deploy changes to your existing environments.

For more details about these files and how they isolate resource types in multiple environments, see environment isolation.

# Installing Puppet Enterprise

You can install PE in a monolithic configuration, where all infrastructure components are installed on one node, or in a split configuration, where the master, PuppetDB, and console are installed on separate nodes.

The installation method you use depends on the configuration you choose. For a monolithic configuration, you can use web-based installation \(recommended\) or text mode, where you provide a configuration file to the installer. For a split configuration, you must install using text mode.

## Download and verify the installation package

PE is distributed in downloadable packages specific to supported operating system versions and architectures. Installation packages include the full installation tarball and a GPG signature \(.asc\) file used to verify authenticity.

### Before you begin

You must have GnuPG installed.

### Procedure

1.  [Download](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-enterprise) the tarball appropriate to your operating system and architecture.

    |`-el-<version and arch>.tar.gz`|RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux, or Oracle Linux|
    |`-ubuntu-<version and arch>.tar.gz`|Ubuntu LTS|
    |`-sles-<version and arch>.tar.gz`|SUSE Linux Enterprise Server|

2.  Import the Puppet public key.

    ```
    wget -O - https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/puppet-gpg-signing-key.pub | gpg --import
    ```

3.  Print the fingerprint of the key.

    ```
    gpg --fingerprint 0x7F438280EF8D349F
    ```

    The primary key fingerprint displays: 6F6B 1550 9CF8 E59E 6E46 9F32 7F43 8280 EF8D 349F.

4.  Verify the release signature of the installation package.

    ```
    $ gpg --verify puppet-enterprise-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz.asc
    ```

    The result is similar to:

    ```
    gpg: Signature made Tue 18 Sep 2016 10:05:25 AM PDT using RSA key ID EF8D349F
    gpg: Good signature from "Puppet, Inc. Release Key (Puppet, Inc. Release Key)"
    ```

    **Note:** If you don't have a trusted path to one of the signatures on the release key, you receive a warning that a valid path to the key couldn't be found.


## Install using web-based installation \(mono configuration\)

Web-based installation uses a web server to guide you through installation. Use web-based installation for a monolithic configuration with or without compile masters.

### Before you begin

Review the [Web-based installation prerequisites](installing_pe.md#).

### About this task

### Procedure

1.  Forward ports to the web-based installer.

    The web-based installer requires access to port 3000 on the machine you're running the installer from. If you can't connect directly to port 3000 — for example, if you're installing PE on a virtual machine or have firewall rules that prevent direct access — you can port forward, or "tunnel," to the installer using SSH.

    -   \*nix

        ```
        ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 jumphost.exmple.tld
        ```

    -   Windows
        1.  Open PuTTY, select **Sessions** and in the **Host Name** field, enter the FQDN of the host you want to run the installer from.

        2.  Select **Tunnels** and in the **Source Port** field, enter 3000.

        3.  In the **Destination** field, enter localhost:3000.

        4.  Select **Local**, click **Add**, and then click **Open**. 

2.  Unpack the installation tarball:

    ```
    tar -xf <TARBALL_FILENAME>
                      
    ```

3.  From the installer directory, run the installer:

    ```
    sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer
    ```

4.  When prompted, choose guided installation

    The installer starts a web server and provides an installer URL.

    The default installer URL is `https://<INSTALL_PLATFORM_HOSTNAME>:3000`. If you forwarded ports in step 1, the URL is `https://localhost:3000`.

5.  In a browser, access the installer URL and accept the security request.

    The installer uses a default SSL certificate. You must add a security exception in order to access the installer.

    **Important:** Leave your terminal connection open until the installation is complete or else installation fails.

6.  Follow the prompts to configure your installation.

7.  On the validation page, verify the configuration and, if there aren't any outstanding issues, click **Deploy now**.

    Installation begins. You can monitor the installation as it runs by toggling **Log View** and **Summary View**. If you notice errors, check `/var/log/puppetlabs/installer/install_log.lastrun.<hostname>.log` on the machine from which you're running the installer.

    When the installation completes, the installer script that was running in the terminal closes.

8.  Click **Start using Puppet Enterprise** to log into the console.

## Install using text mode \(mono configuration\)

When you run the installer in text mode, you provide a configuration file \(`pe.conf`\) to the installer. The `pe.conf` file contains values for the parameters needed for installation.

### Procedure

1.  Unpack the installation tarball:

    ```
    tar -xf <TARBALL_FILENAME>
                      
    ```

2.  From the installer directory, run the installer. The installation steps vary depending on the path you choose.

    -   To use a `pe.conf` file that you've previously populated, run the installer **with the `-c` flag** pointed at the `pe.conf` file.:

        ```
        sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer -c <FULL PATH TO pe.conf>
        ```

    -   To have the installer open a copy of `pe.conf` for you to edit and install with, run the installer **without the `-c` flag**:

        ```
        sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer
        ```

        1.  Select **text-mode** when prompted.

        2.  Specify required installation parameters.

        3.  If you have an external PostgreSQL server, refer to the external PostgreSQL parameters in the pe.conf reference and add them to `pe.conf`.

        4.  Save and close the file. Installation begins.

3.  After the installation completes, run Puppet twice: `puppet agent -t`.

## Install using text mode \(split configuration\)

When you run the installer in text mode, you provide a configuration file \(`pe.conf`\) to the installer. The `pe.conf` file contains values for the parameters needed for installation.

### About this task

**Note:** You must install the components in the order specified.

### Install the master

Installing the master is the first step in setting up a split installation.

#### Procedure

1.  Unpack the installation tarball:

    ```
    tar -xf <TARBALL_FILENAME>
                      
    ```

2.  From the installer directory, run the installer. The installation steps vary depending on the path you choose.

    -   To use a `pe.conf` file that you've previously populated, run the installer **with the `-c` flag** pointed at the `pe.conf` file.:

        ```
        sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer -c <FULL PATH TO pe.conf>
        ```

    -   To have the installer open a copy of `pe.conf` for you to edit and install with, run the installer **without the `-c` flag**:

        ```
        sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer
        ```

        1.  Select **text-mode** when prompted.

        2.  Specify required installation parameters.

        3.  If you have an external PostgreSQL server, refer to the external PostgreSQL parameters in the pe.conf reference and add them to `pe.conf`.

        4.  Save and close the file. Installation begins.

3.  When installation completes, transfer the installer and the `pe.conf` file located at `/etc/puppetlabs/enterprise/conf.d/` to the next server that you're installing a component on.


### Install PuppetDB

In a split installation, after you install the master, you're ready to install PuppetDB.

#### About this task

#### Procedure

1.  Unpack the installation tarball:

    ```
    tar -xf <TARBALL_FILENAME>
                      
    ```

2.  From the installer directory, run the installer:

    ```
    sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer -c <FULL PATH TO pe.conf>
    ```

3.  When installation completes, transfer the installer and the `pe.conf` file located at `/etc/puppetlabs/enterprise/conf.d/` to the next server that you're installing a component on.


### Install the console

In a split installation, after you install the master and PuppetDB, you're ready to install the console.

#### About this task

#### Procedure

1.  Unpack the installation tarball:

    ```
    tar -xf <TARBALL_FILENAME>
                      
    ```

2.  From the installer directory, run the installer:

    ```
    sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer -c <FULL PATH TO pe.conf>
    ```

## Web-based installation prerequisites

Review these prerequisites and tips before beginning a web-based installation.

-   If you've previously installed Puppet or Puppet Enterprise, make sure that the machine you're installing on is free of any artifacts left over from the previous installation.

-   Make sure that DNS is properly configured on the machines you're installing on.

-   All nodes must know their own hostnames, which you can achieve by properly configuring reverse DNS on your local DNS server, or by setting the hostname explicitly. Setting the hostname usually involves the `hostname` command and one or more configuration files, but the exact method varies by platform.

-   All nodes must be able to reach each other by name, which you can achieve with a local DNS server, or by editing the `/etc/hosts` file on each node to point to the proper IP addresses.

-   You can run the installer from a machine that is part of your deployment or from a machine that is outside your deployment. If you want to run the installer from a machine that is part of your deployment, in a split installation, run the installer from the node assigned the console component.

-   The machine you run the installer from must have the same operating system and architecture as your deployment.

-   The web-based installer does not support sudo configurations with `Defaults targetpw` or `Defaults rootpw`. Make sure your `/etc/sudoers` file does not contain, or comment out, those lines.

-   For Debian users, if you gave the root account a password during installation of Debian, sudo may not have been installed. In this case, you must either install as root, or install sudo on any nodes on which you want to install.


### SSH prerequisites

SSH requirements very depending on your installation method.

You don't need to take additional steps to configure SSH if you:

-   Choose **Install on this server** during installation.


-   Have a properly configured SSH agent with agent forwarding enabled.


If you're using SSH keys to authenticate across nodes, the public key for the user account performing the installation must be included in the `authorized_keys` file for that user account on each infrastructure node, including the machine from which you're running the installer. This requirement applies to root or non-root users.

|Installation method|Requirements|Prerequisites|
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
|Root with a password|The installer requires the username and password for each infrastructure node.|Remote root SSH login must be enabled on each infrastructure node, including the node from which you're running the installer.|
|Non-root with a password|Sudo must be enabled for the non-root user on each infrastructure node.|
|Root with an SSH key|The installer requires the username, private key path, and key passphrase \(as needed\) for each infrastructure node.|-   Remote root SSH login must enabled on each node, including the node from which you're running the installer.

-   The public root ssh key must be added to `authorized_keys` on each infrastructure node.


|
|Non-root with an SSH key|-   The non-root user must be granted sudo access on each infrastructure node.

-   The non-root user SSH key must be added to `authorized_keys` on each infrastructure node.


|

## Web-based installation options

Use this reference when providing values in the web-based installer.

SSH details are required only if you opt to install on another server. 

|Setting|Value|
|-------|-----|
|**Puppet master FQDN**|Fully qualified domain name of the server you're installing on. This FQDN is used as the name of the master certificate. This FQDN must be resolvable from the machine on which you're running the installer. 

To ensure you're using the proper FQDN for the monolithic master, run `sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet config print certname` when the installation completes. If the installation fails because the FQDN value is incorrect, run the `config print certname` command and re-run the installer with the correct value.

|
|**DNS altnames**|Comma-separated list of static, valid, DNS altnames so agents can trust the master. Make sure that this static list contains the DNS name or alias you’re be configuring your agents to contact. The default settings include `puppet`.|
|**SSH username**|Username to use when connecting to the master. This user must either be root or have sudo access. The default value is `root`.|
|**SSH password**|Password associated with the SSH username. This password is used only if the user requires a password for sudo access.|
|**SSH key file path**|Absolute path to the SSH key on the machine you're performing the installation from. This value is used if an SSH password is not specified. Defaults to the root SSH key path.|
|**SSH key passphrase**|Passphrase for the SSH key, if applicable.|

## Text mode installer options

When you run the installer in text mode, you can use the `-c` option to specify the full path to an existing `pe.conf` file. You can pair these additional options with the `-c` option.

|Option|Definition|
|------|----------|
|`-D`|Display debugging information|
|`-q`|Run in quiet mode. The installation process isn't displayed. If errors occur during the installation, the command quits with an error message.|
|`-y`|Run automatically using the `pe.conf` file at `/etc/puppetlabs/enterprise/conf.d/`. If the file is not present or is invalid, installation or upgrade fails.|
|`-V`|Display verbose debugging information.|
|`-h`|Display help information.|
|`force`|For upgrades only, bypass PostgreSQL migration validation. This option must appear last, after the end-of-options signifier \(`--`\), for example `sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer -c pe.conf -- --force`|

## Configuration parameters and the `pe.conf` file

A `pe.conf` file is a HOCON formatted file that declares parameters and values needed to install, upgrade, and configure PE.

You can create or obtain a `pe.conf` file by:

-   Using the example `pe.conf` file provided in the `conf.d` directory in the installer tarball. This example file contains the mandatory parameters needed for a monolithic or split installation.

    **Tip:** In most cases, for a monolithic installation, you can use the example `pe.conf` file without making any changes.

-   Selecting the text-mode installation option when prompted by the installer. This option opens your default text editor with the example `pe.conf` file, which you can modify as needed. Installation proceeds using that `pe.conf` after you quit the editor.
-   Using the web-based installer to create a `pe.conf` file. After you run the web-based installer, you can find the file at `/etc/puppetlabs/enterprise/conf.d`. You can also download the file by following the link provided on the confirmation page of the web-based installer.

The following are examples of valid paramater and value expressions:

|Type|Value|
|----|-----|
|FQDNs|`"puppet_enterprise::puppet_master_host": "master.example.com"`|
|Strings|`"console_admin_password": "mypassword"`|
|Arrays|`[ "puppet", "puppetlb-01.example.com" ]`|
|Booleans|`"puppet_enterprise::profile::master::app_management": true` Valid Boolean values are `true` or `false` \(case sensitive, no quotation marks\).

 **Note:** Don't use Yes \(y\), No \(n\), 1, or 0.

|
|JSON hashes|`"puppet_enterprise::profile::orchestrator::java_args": {"Xmx": "256m", "Xms": "256m"}`|
|Integer|`"puppet_enterprise::profile::console::rbac_session_timeout": "60"`|

**Important:** Don't use single quotes on parameter values. Use double quotes as shown in the examples.

### Installation parameters

These `pe.conf` parameters are required for installation.

Parameters differ for monolithic and split configurations.

|Parameter|Value|Configuration|
|---------|-----|-------------|
|`console_admin_password`|The password to log into the console, for example `"myconsolepassword"`.|Monolithic and split|
|`puppet_enterprise::puppet_master_host`|The FQDN of the node hosting the master, for example `master.example.com`.

**Note:** In a monolithic installation, you may leave the default `"%{::trusted.certname}`" value. In a split installation, you must change this value.

|Monolithic and split|
|`puppet_enterprise::console_host`|The FQDN of the node hosting the console, for example `puppetconsole.example.com`.|Split|
|`puppet_enterprise::puppetdb_host`|The FQDN of the node hosting PuppetDB, for example `puppetdb.example.com`.|Split|

-   **`puppet_enterprise::profile::orchestrator::job_prune_threshold`**

    Integer representing the days after which job reports should be removed.

    Default: `"30"` days

-   **`puppet_enterprise::profile::orchestrator::pcp_timeout`**

    Integer representing the length of time, in seconds, before timeout when agents attempt to connect to the Puppet Communications Protocol broker in a Puppet run triggered by the orchestrator.

    Default: `"30"` seconds

-   **`puppet_enterprise::profile::orchestrator::run_service`**

    `true` to enable orchestration services, or `false`.

    Default: `true`

-   **`puppet_enterprise::profile::orchestrator::task_concurrency`**

    Integer representing the number of tasks that can run at the same time.

    Default: `"250"` tasks

-   **`puppet_enterprise::profile::orchestrator::use_application_services`**

    `true` to enable application management, or `false`.

    Default: `false`

-   **`puppet_enterprise::pxp_agent::ping_interval`**

    Integer representing the interval, in seconds, between agents' attempts to ping Puppet Communications Protocol brokers.

    Default: `"120"` seconds

-   **`puppet_enterprise::pxp_agent::pxp_logfile`**

    String representing the path to the Puppet Execution Protocol agent log file. Change as needed.

    Default: `/var/log/puppetlabs/pxp-agent/pxp-agent.log` \(\*nix\) or `C:/ProgramData/PuppetLabs/pxp-agent/var/log/pxp-agent.log` \(Windows\)

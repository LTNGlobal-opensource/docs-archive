# Maintenance

-   **[Puppet Enterprise database maintenance](pe_database_maintenance.md#)**  
You can optimize the Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) databases to improve performance. We recommend that you regularly back up the databases.
-   **[Back up and restore a Puppet Enterprise installation](back_up_and_restore_a_pe_installation.md#)**  
After you have Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) installed, we recommend that you keep regular backups of your PE infrastructure. Regular backups allow you to recover from failed upgrades between versions, to troubleshoot those upgrades, and to quickly recover in the case of system failures.

# Reviewing jobs

You can review jobs you've run—on-demand Puppet runs or tasks—from the console or the orchestrator CLI.

-   **[Reviewing jobs in the console](reviewing_jobs_in_the_console.md#)**  
In the console, you can view a list of recent jobs and drill down to see useful details about each one.
-   **[Reviewing jobs on the CLI](reviewing_jobs_on_the_cli.md#)**  
Use the `puppet job show` command to view running or completed orchestration jobs.

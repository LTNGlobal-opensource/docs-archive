# Help us localize docs

The Technical Publications team at Puppet is pursuing a long-term plan to translate our user documentation into as many languages as possible, but we need your help!

If you are interested in contributing to localization of our documentation into your native language, you can either join an existing language team, or request the formation of a new language team.

We currently have the following language teams:

-   Japanese
-   Spanish
-   German

## Create a localization account

These steps describe how to create an account in our translation management tool, and get started translating content.

### About this task

### Procedure

1.  Select the project you are interested in contributing to.

    Currently we have these:

    -   Open source Puppet documentation

    -   Puppet Enterprise documentation

2.  To access these projects, [create an account with Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/signup/), our translation management software, and then navigate to either [Open source Puppet](https://www.transifex.com/puppet/puppet-documentation/) or [Puppet Enterprise](https://www.transifex.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise/) documentation.

3.  Click **Help Translate \(project name\)** and get started translating.Â 


## Join an existing language team

Puppet has some existing language projects already set up.

After you've logged in to Transifex and accessed the project, click **Join team** and select the language team that you're interested in.

## Request a new language team

You can request a new language if we are not yet supporting your language.

If your language doesn't exist as one of our options yet, log in to Transifex, follow the links in **Create an account** to access your project of interest, and click **Request language**.

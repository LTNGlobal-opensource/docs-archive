# Upgrading

To upgrade your Puppet Enterprise deployment, you must upgrade both the infrastructure components and agents.

-   **[Upgrading Puppet Enterprise](upgrading_pe.md#)**  
Upgrade your PE installation as new versions become available.
-   **[Upgrading agents](upgrading_agents.md#)**  
Upgrade your agents as new versions of Puppet Enterprise become available. The upgrade method you use depends on the agent operating system and the method used to install the agent.

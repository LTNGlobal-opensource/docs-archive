# What gets installed and where?

Puppet Enterprise installs several software components, configuration files, databases, services and users, and log files. It's useful to know the locations of these should you ever need to troubleshoot or manage your infrastructure.

## Software components installed

PE installs several software components and dependencies.

The functional components of the software are separated between those packaged with the agent and those packaged on the server side \(which also includes the agent\).

**Note:** PE also installs other dependencies, as documented in the system requirements.

This table shows the components installed on all agent nodes.

**Note:** Hiera 5 is a backwards-compatible evolution of Hiera, which is built into Puppet 4.9.0 and higher. To provide some backwards-compatible features, it uses the classic Hiera 3.x.x codebase version listed in this table.

## Executable binaries and symlinks installed

PE installs executable binaries and symlinks for interacting with tools and services.

On \*nix nodes, all software is installed under `/opt/puppetlabs`.

On Windows nodes, all software is installed in `Program Files` at `Puppet Labs\Puppet`.

Executable binaries on \*nix are in `/opt/puppetlabs/bin` and `/opt/puppetlabs/sbin`.

**Tip:** To include binaries in your default `$PATH`, manually add them to your profile or export the path:

```
PATH=/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/server/bin:$PATH;export PATH
```

To make essential Puppet tools available to all users, the installer automatically creates symlinks in `/usr/local/bin` for the `facter`, `puppet`, `pe-man`, `r10k`, `hiera`, and `mco` binaries. Symlinks are created only if `/usr/local/bin` is writeable. Users of AIX and Solaris versions 10 and 11 must add `/usr/local/bin` to their default path.

For macOS agents, symlinks aren't created until the first successful run that applies the agents' catalogs.

**Tip:** You can disable symlinks by changing the `manage_symlinks` setting in your default Hiera file:

```
puppet_enterprise::manage_symlinks: false
```

Binaries provided by other software components, such as those for interacting with the PostgreSQL server, PuppetDB, or Ruby packages, do not have symlinks created.

## Modules and plugins installed

PE installs modules and plugins for normal operations.

-   Modules included with the software are installed on the master in `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`. Don't modify anything in this directory or add modules of your own. Instead, install non-default modules in `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/<environment>/modules`.
-   MCollective plugins are installed in `/opt/puppetlabs/mcollective/plugins/` on \*nix and in `<COMMON_APPDATA>``\PuppetLabs\mcollective\etc\plugins\mcollective` on Windows. If you are adding new plugins to agent nodes, distribute them with Puppet.

## Configuration files installed

PE installs configuration files that you might need to interact with from time to time.

On \*nix nodes, configuration files live at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`.

On Windows nodes, configuration files live at `<COMMON_APPDATA>\PuppetLabs`. The location of this folder varies by Windows version; in 2008 and 2012, its default location is `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc`.

The software's `confdir` is in the `puppet` subdirectory. This directory contains the `puppet.conf` file, `auth.conf`, and the SSL directory.

## Tools installed

PE installs several suites of tools to help you work with the major components of the software.

-   **Puppet tools** — Tools that control basic functions of the software such as `puppet master` and `puppet cert.`
-   **Client tools** — The pe-client-tools package collects a set of CLI tools that extend the ability for you to access services from the master or a workstation. This package includes:
    -   **Orchestrator** — The orchestrator is a set of interactive command line tools that provide the interface to the orchestration service. Orchestrator also enables you to enforce change on the environment level. Tools include `puppet job` and `puppet app`.
    -   **Puppet Access** — Users can generate tokens to authenticate their access to certain command line tools and API endpoints.
    -   **Code Manager CLI** — The `puppet-code` command allows you to trigger Code Manager from the command line to deploy your environments.
    -   **PuppetDB CLI** — This a tool for working with PuppetDB, including building queries and handling exports.
-   **MCollective tools** — Tools used to invoke simultaneous actions across a number of nodes. These tools are built on the MCollective framework and are accessed via the `mco` command.
-   **Module tool** — The module tool is used to access and create modules, which are reusable chunks of Puppet code users have written to automate configuration and deployment tasks. For more information, and to access modules, visit the Forge.
-   **Console** — The console is the web user interface for PE. The console provides tools to view and edit resources on your nodes, view reports and activity graphs, and more.

## Databases installed

PE installs several default databases, all of which use PostgreSQL as a database backend.

The PE PostgreSQL database includes these following databases.

|Database|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|pe-activity|Activity data from the classifier, including who, what, and when.|
|pe-classifier|Classification data, all node group information.|
|pe-puppetdb|PuppetDB data, including exported resources, catalogs, facts, and reports.|
|pe-rbac|RBAC data, including users, permissions, and AD/LDAP info.|
|pe-orchestrator|Orchestrator data, including details about job runs.|

Use the native PostgreSQL tools to perform database exports and imports. At a minimum, you should perform backups to a remote system nightly, or as dictated by your company policy.

## Services installed

PE installs several services used to interact with the software during normal operations.

|Service|Definition|
|-------|----------|
|pe-activemq|The ActiveMQ message server, which passes messages to the MCollective servers on agent nodes. Runs on servers with the master component.|
|pe-console-services|Manages and serves the console.|
|pe-puppetserver|Runs the master server, which manages the master component.|
|pe-nginx|Nginx, serves as a reverse-proxy to the console.|

## Log files installed

The software distributed with PE generates log files that you can collect for compliance or use for troubleshooting.

### Master logs

The master has these logs.

-   `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log` — The master application logs its activity, including compilation errors and deprecation warnings, here.

-   `/var/log/puppetlabs/orchestration-services/pcp-broker-access.log`
-   `/var/log/puppetlabs/pxp-agent/pxp-agent.log` \(on \*nix\) or `C:/ProgramData/PuppetLabs/pxp-agent/var/log/pxp-agent.log` \(on Windows\) — Contains the Puppet Execution Protocol agent log file.

## Certificates installed

During installation, the software generates and installs a number of SSL certificates so that agents and services can authenticate themselves.

These certs can be found at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs`.

Services that run on the master or console — for example, `pe-orchestration-services` and `pe-console-services` — use the agent certificate to authenticate.

|Cert|Definition|
|----|----------|
|<MASTER CERTNAME\>|Generated during install. In a monolithic install, this cert is used by PuppetDB and the console. This is the same value for the agent's certname that runs on the master. In a monolithic install, the agent on the console and PuppetDB share this certname. In a default monolithic or split install, this is also the CA certificate.|
|<CONSOLE CERTNAME\>|The certificate for the console, which is generated only if you have a split install. This is the same value for the agent's certname that runs on the console.|
|<PUPPETDB CERTNAME\>|The certificate for PuppetDB, which is generated only if you have a split install. This is the same value for the agent's certname that runs on PuppetDB.|
|pe-internal-mcollective-servers|A certificate generated on the master and shared to all agent nodes.|
|pe-internal-peadmin-mcollective-client|The certificate for the peadmin account on the master.|
|pe-internal-puppet-console-mcollective-client|The MCollective certificate for the console.|

# Orchestrating Puppet and tasks

The orchestrator is the most effective tool for forcing on-demand change in your infrastructure.

-   **[Running jobs with Puppet orchestrator](running_jobs_with_puppet_orchestrator_overview.md#)**  
With the Puppet orchestrator, you can run two types of "jobs": on-demand Puppet runs or Puppet tasks.
-   **[Configuring Puppet orchestrator](configuring_puppet_orchestrator.md#)**  
Once you've installed PE or the client tools package, there are a few tasks you need to do to prepare your PE infrastructure for orchestration services.
-   **[Direct Puppet: a workflow for controlling change](direct_puppet_a_workflow_for_controlling_change.md#)**  
The orchestrator—used alongside other PE tools, such as Code Manager—allows you to control when and how infrastructure changes are made before they reach your production environment.
-   **[Running Puppet on demand](running_puppet_on_demand_with_orch.md)**  
The orchestrator gives you the ability to set up jobs in the console or on the command line to trigger on-demand Puppet runs.
-   **[Running tasks](running_tasks.md)**  
The orchestrator gives you the ability to set up jobs in the console or on the command line to run ad hoc or arbitrary tasks across systems in your infrastructure.
-   **[Reviewing jobs](reviewing_jobs.md)**  
You can review jobs you've run—on-demand Puppet runs or tasks—from the console or the orchestrator CLI.
-   **[Puppet orchestrator API v1 endpoints](orchestrator_api_v1_endpoints.md)**  
The Puppet orchestrator API v1 consists of the following endpoints.

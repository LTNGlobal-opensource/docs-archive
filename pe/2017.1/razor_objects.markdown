Provisioning with Razor requires certain objects that define how nodes are provisioned.

+ [Repositories](./razor_repos.html) -- Contain objects used for installation, such as operating systems.
+ [Tasks](./razor_tasks.html) -- Define the actions Razor performs on a node, most commonly installation of a specified operating system.
+ [Tags](./razor_tags.html) -- Identify nodes based on their characteristics.
+ [Policies](./razor_policies.html) -- Tell Razor which repositories, brokers, and tasks to use for provisioning.
+ [Brokers](./razor_brokers.html) -- Hand off management of a node after provisioning.
+ [Hooks](./razor_hooks.html) -- Run scripts in response to certain events in a node's lifecycle.

Brokers hand off nodes to configuration management systems like Puppet Enterprise. Brokers consist of two parts: a broker type and information specific to the broker type.

Razor ships with three default broker types:

* `puppet-pe` -- Hands off node management to Puppet Enterprise. This broker specifies the address of the Puppet server, the Puppet Enterprise version, and for Windows, the location of the Windows agent installer.
* `puppet` -- Hands off management to open source Puppet. This broker specifies the address of the Puppet server, the node certname, and the environment.
* `noop` -- Doesn't hand off management. A no-op broker can be useful for getting started quickly or doing a basic installation without configuration management.

You can create brokers using the `create-broker` command. You can also update configuration details for the broker and delete brokers.

Writing new broker types is only necessary to use Razor with other configuration management systems.

## Storage directories

There are two directories that store brokers:

* `/opt/puppetlabs/server/apps/razor-server/share/razor-server/brokers` stores default brokers shipped with the product.
* `/etc/puppetlabs/razor-server/brokers` stores custom brokers that you create.

**Tip**: We recommend not modifying the directory or brokers at `/opt...`, but you can copy brokers from there to the custom broker directory and modify them as needed.

## Create a PE broker

To create a PE broker that enrolls nodes with the Puppet master at `puppet-master.example.com`:

     razor create-broker --name puppet-pe \
        --configuration server=puppet.example.org \
        --configuration version=2015.3

## Create a new broker type

To create a broker called `sample`:

1. From the command line, create a `sample.broker` directory anywhere on the `broker_path`.

   The `broker_path` is specified in the `broker_path` class parameter of the `pe_razor` class. By default, the broker directory for custom brokers is `/etc/puppetlabs/razor-server/brokers`.
2. [Write the broker install script](#write-the-broker-install-script) and place it in the `install.erb` (*nix) or `install.ps1.erb` (Windows Powershell) template in the `sample.broker` directory.
3. If the broker type requires configuration data, [write the broker configuration file](#write-the-broker-configuration-file) and save it in the `sample.broker` directory.

### Write the broker install script

The broker install script is generated from the `install.erb` (*nix) or `install.ps1.erb` (Windows) template of your broker. The template returns a valid shell script because tasks generally perform the handoff to the broker by running a command like `curl -s <%= broker_install_url %> | /bin/bash`. The `GET` request to `broker_install_url` (*nix) or `broker_install_url('install.ps1')` (Windows) returns the brokerâ€™s install script after interpolating the template.

In the install template, you have access to two objects: `node` and `broker`. The `node` object gives you access to node facts (`node.facts["example"]`), tags (`node.tags`), and metadata (`node.metadata['key']`).

The `broker` object gives you access to the configuration settings. For
example, if your `configuration.yaml` specifies that a setting `version`
must be provided when creating a broker from this broker type, you can
access the value of `version` for the current broker as `broker.version`.

### Write the broker configuration file

The `configuration.yaml` file indicates what parameters can be supplied for any given broker type. For each parameter, you can supply these attributes:

* `description` - Human-readable description of the parameter.
* `required` - `true` to indicate that the parameter must be supplied. Parameters that aren't required are optional.
* `default` - Value for the parameter if one isn't supplied.

As an example, here's the configuration.yaml for the PE broker type:

    server:
        description: "The puppet master to load configurations and installation packages from."
    version:
        description: "Override the PE version to install; defaults to `current`."
    windows_agent_download_url:
        description: "The download URL for a Windows PE agent installer; defaults to a URL derived from the `version` config."

If you need a customized r10k configuration, set parameters for the `pe_r10k` class [in Hiera][hiera].
 
To set these parameters, add keys to your control repository hierarchy in the `hieradata/common.yaml` file in the format `pe_r10k::<parameter>`. For example:

```
pe_r10k::cachedir: /var/cache/r10k
pe_r10k::remote: git://git-server.site/my-org/main-modules
```

> Warning: Do not edit r10kâ€™s configuration file manually. Puppet manages this configuration automatically and will undo any manual changes you make.

## Parameters

### `cachedir`

Specifies the path to the directory where you want the cache of your Git repos to be stored.

Accepts a string, such as `/var/cache/r10k`.

### `forge_settings`

Contains settings for downloading modules from the Puppet Forge. Accepts a hash of the following values:

#### baseurl

Indicates where Forge modules should be installed from. Defaults to `https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com`.

``` yaml
pe_r10k::forge_settings:
  baseurl: 'https://private-forge.mysite'
```

#### proxy

Sets or overrides the global proxy setting for all Forge interactions. See the global `proxy` setting below for more information and examples.

### `git_settings`

Contains Git-specific settings. Accepts a hash of values, such as:

```yaml
pe_r10k::git_settings:
  provider: "rugged"
  private_key: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa"
  username: "git"
```
You can specify the following in `git_settings`:

#### provider

Specifies what Git provider to use. You can use one of two providers for r10k: rugged and shellgit.

We recommend the Rugged provider, which is also the only supported provider for configuring r10k with `pe.conf` or the master profile. Rugged requires Ruby 1.9 or greater.

However, existing r10k installations and customized configurations default to the shellgit provider. If you are using shellgit, [install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on both your Puppet master and on the Puppet code development machine.

#### private_key

Required, but can be supplied by the master profile. Specifies the file containing the default private key used to access control repositories, such as `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa`. This file must have read permissions for the `pe-puppet` user. The SSH key cannot require a password.

#### proxy

Sets or overrides the global proxy setting specifically for Git operations that use an HTTP(S) transport. See the global `proxy` setting below for more information and examples.

#### repositories

A list of repositories and their respective private keys. Use this setting if you want to use multiple control repos. To use multiple control repos, the `sources` setting and the `repositories` setting must match.

  * `remote`: The repository these settings should apply to.
  * `private_key`: The file containing the private key to use for this repository. This file must have read permissions for the `pe-puppet` user. This setting overrides the global `private_key` setting.
  * `proxy`: The `proxy` setting allows you to set or override the global proxy setting for a single, specific repository. See the global `proxy` setting below for more information and examples.

  
This setting accepts an array of hashes in the following format:
  
```yaml
pe_r10k::git_settings:
  repositories:
    - remote: "ssh://tessier-ashpool.freeside/protected-repo.git"
      private_key: "/etc/puppetlabs/r10k/ssh/id_rsa-protected-repo-deploy-key"
    - remote: "https://git.example.com/my-repo.git"
      proxy: "https://proxy.example.com:3128"
```

#### username

Optionally, specify a username when the Git remote URL does not provide a username. 

### `proxy`

Configures a proxy server to use for all operations that occur over an HTTP(S) transport. To override this setting for Git or Forge operations only, set the `proxy` parameter under [`git_settings`](#git_settings) or [`forge_settings`](#forge_settings). To override for a specific Git repository, set a proxy in the `repositories` list of `git_settings`. To override this setting with no proxy for Git, Forge, or a particular repository, set that specific `proxy` setting to an empty string.

By default, r10k looks for and uses the first environment variable it finds in this list: HTTPS_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy. If no proxy setting is found in the environment, this setting defaults to use no proxy.

```yaml
proxy: 'http://proxy.example.com:3128'
```

r10k also supports authenticated proxies with either Basic or Digest authentication:

```yaml
proxy: 'http://user:password@proxy.example.com:3128'
```

The proxy server used is logged at the "debug" level when r10k runs.


### `postrun`

An optional command to be run after r10k finishes deploying environments. The command must be an array of strings to be used as an argument vector.

```yaml
  - "/usr/bin/curl"
  - "-F"
  - "deploy=done"
  - "http://my-app.site/endpoint"
```

### `remote`

Specifies where the source repository should be fetched from. The remote must be able to be fetched without any interactive input. That is, you cannot be prompted for usernames or passwords in order to fetch the remote. If `remote` is set, you cannot use `sources`.

Accepts a string that is any valid SSH URL that r10k can clone, such as: 

`git://git-server.site/my-org/main-modules`


### `r10k_basedir`

Specifies the path where environments will be created for this source. This directory is entirely managed by r10k, and any contents that r10k did not put there will be removed. If `r10k_basedir` is not set, it uses the default `environmentpath` in your `puppet.conf` file. If `r10k_basedir` is set, you cannot set the `sources` parameter.

Note that the `r10k_basedir` setting **must match** the `environmentpath` in your puppet.conf file, or Puppet won't be able to access your new directory environments.

Accepts a string, such as: `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments`.

### `sources` 

This setting is used if you are managing more than just Puppet environments, such as when you are also managing Hiera data in its own control repository. Note that if `sources` is set, you cannot use the `remote` and `r10k_basedir` settings above.

The `sources` setting can include the following subsettings:

* [remote](#remote)
* [basedir](#basedir)
* [prefix](#prefix)
* [invalid_branches](#invalidbranches)

This setting accepts a hash such as:

```yaml
myorg: 
  remote: "git://git-server.site/myorg/main-modules"
  basedir: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments"
  prefix: true
mysource: 
  remote: "git://git-server.site/mysource/main-modules"
  basedir: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments"
  prefix: "testing"
```

Note that r10k raises an error if different sources collide in a single base directory. If you are using multiple sources, use the [prefix](#prefix) option to prevent collisions.

#### remote

Specifies where the source repository should be fetched from. The remote must be able to be fetched without any interactive input. That is, you cannot be prompted for usernames or passwords in order to fetch the remote.

Accepts a string that is any valid URL that r10k can clone, such as: 

`git://git-server.site/my-org/main-modules`

#### basedir

Specifies the path where environments will be created for this source. This directory is entirely managed by r10k, and any contents that r10k did not put there will be removed.

Note that the `basedir` setting **must match** the `environmentpath` in your puppet.conf file, or Puppet won't be able to access your new directory environments.

#### prefix

Allows environment names to be prefixed with this string. Alternatively, if `prefix` is set to true, the source's name will be used. This prevents collisions when multiple sources are deployed into the same directory.

In the `sources` example above, two "main-modules" environments are set up in the same base directory. The prefix setting is used to differentiate the environments: the first will be named "myorg-main-modules", and the second will be "testing-main-modules".

#### invalid_branches

Specifies how branch names that cannot be cleanly mapped to Puppet environments are handled. This option accepts three values:

* 'correct_and_warn' is the default value and replaces non-word characters with underscores and issues a warning.
* 'correct' replaces non-word characters with underscores without warning.
* 'error' ignores branches with non-word characters and issues an error.

```yaml
mysource: 
  basedir: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments"
  invalid_branches: "error"
  remote: "git://git-server.site/mysource/main-modules"
```

## Next steps

Next, [run r10k][run] to deploy your environments. PE does not automatically run r10k at the end of installation.

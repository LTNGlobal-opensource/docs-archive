## License file

Your PE license file (which was emailed to you when you purchased Puppet Enterprise) should be placed in `/etc/puppetlabs/license.key`.

Puppet Enterprise can be evaluated with a complimentary 10-node license; beyond that, a commercial per-node license is required for use. A license key file is emailed to you after your purchase. On a monolithic installation, the Puppet master looks for this key at `/etc/puppetlabs/license.key`. On a split installation, it looks for this key at `/etc/puppetlabs/license.key` on the Puppet master and the PE console nodes. Puppet will log warnings if the license is expired or exceeded. You can view the status of your license by running `puppet license` at the command line on the Puppet master.

To purchase a license, please see the [Puppet Enterprise pricing page](https://puppet.com/product/pricing), or contact Puppet at <sales@puppet.com> or (877) 575-9775. If you have misplaced or never received your license key, please contact <sales@puppet.com>.

### License files in the console

The **Licenses** menu shows you the number of nodes that are currently active and the number of nodes still available on your current license. If the number of available licenses is exceeded, a warning will be displayed. The number of licenses used is determined by the number of active nodes known to PuppetDB. This is a change from previous behavior which used the number of unrevoked certs known by the CA to determine used licenses. The menu item provides convenient links to purchase and pricing information.

Unused nodes will be deactivated automatically after seven days with no activity (no new facts, catalog or reports), or you can use `puppet node deactivate` for immediate results.

## Puppet Enterprise software components

### What is installed?

The functional components of PE are separated between those packaged with the puppet-agent and those packaged on the server side (which also includes the puppet-agent). 

In addition the pe-client-tools package collects a set of CLI tools that extend the ability for you to access Puppet Enterprise services from the Puppet master or a workstation. See [installing the PE client tools package](./install_pe_client_tools.html) for more information.

PE 2016.2 includes the following major software components.

{% partial /pe/_versions_2016.md %}

### Where is it installed?

On \*nix nodes, all PE software (excluding config files and generated data) is installed under `/opt/puppetlabs`.

On Windows nodes, all PE software is installed in the "Puppet Enterprise" subdirectory of [the standard 32-bit applications directory](./install_windows.html#program-directory)

* Executable binaries on \*nix are in `/opt/puppetlabs/bin` and `/opt/puppetlabs/sbin`. The Installation Overview provides more info about [PE binaries and symlinks](./install_basic.html#puppet-enterprise-binaries-and-symlinks)
* The Puppet modules included with PE are installed on the Puppet master server in `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`. Don't modify anything in this directory or add modules of your own. Instead, install them in `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/<environment>/modules`.
* MCollective plugins are installed in `/opt/puppetlabs/mcollective/plugins/` on \*nix and in [`<COMMON_APPDATA>`](./install_windows.html#data-directory)`\PuppetLabs\mcollective\etc\plugins\mcollective` on Windows. If you are adding new plugins to your PE agent nodes, you should [distribute them via Puppet as described in the "Adding actions" page of this manual](./orchestration_adding_actions.html).

### Dependencies

For information about PostgreSQL and OpenSSL requirements, refer to the [system requirements](./install_system_requirements.html#dependencies-and-os-specific-details).

### Configuration files

On *nix nodes, Puppet Enterprise's configuration files all live under `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`.

On Windows nodes, Puppet Enterprise's configuration files all live under `<COMMON_APPDATA>\PuppetLabs`. The location of this folder [varies by Windows version](./install_windows.html#data-directory); in 2008 and 2012, its default location is `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc`.

Puppet's `confdir` is in the `puppet` subdirectory. This directory contains the [`puppet.conf`](/guides/configuring.html) file, `auth.conf`, and the SSL directory.

### Log files

The software distributed with Puppet Enterprise generates the following log files, which can be found as follows.

#### Puppet master logs

The Puppet master service's logging are contained in two files:

* `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log`: the Puppet master application logs its activity here; this is where things like compilation errors and deprecation warnings can be found.
* `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver-daemon.log`: this is where fatal errors or crash reports can be found.

#### Puppet agent logs

On *nix nodes, the Puppet agent service logs its activity to the syslog service. Your syslog configuration dictates where these messages will be saved, but the default location is `/var/log/messages` on Linux, `/var/log/system.log` on Mac OS X, and `/var/adm/messages` on Solaris.

On Windows nodes, the Puppet agent service logs its activity to the Windows Event Log. You can view its logs by browsing the Event Viewer. (Control Panel → System and Security → Administrative Tools → Event Viewer)

#### ActiveMQ logs

- `/var/log/puppetlabs/activemq/wrapper.log`
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/activemq/activemq.log`
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/activemq/data/audit.log`

#### MCollective service logs

- `/var/log/puppetlabs/mcollective.log`: maintained by the MCollective service, which is installed on all nodes.
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/mcollective-audit.log`: exists on all nodes that have MCollective installed; logs any MCollective actions run on the node, including information about the client that called the node

#### Console logs

- `/var/log/puppetlabs/nginx/error.log`: contains errors related to nginx. Console errors that don't get logged anywhere else can be found in this log. If you have problems with the console or Puppet, this log may be useful.
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/console-services.log`
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/console-services-access.log`
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/console-services-daemon.log`: this is where fatal errors or crash reports can be found.

#### Installer logs

- `/var/log/puppetlabs/installer/http.log`: contains the web requests sent to the installer; present only on the machine from which the web-based install was performed
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/installer/installer-<timestamp>.log`: contains the operations performed and any errors that occurred during installation
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install`: contains the contents of the answer file used to install PE; passwords are redacted from this file
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/installer/install_log.lastrun.<hostname>.log`: contains the contents of the last installer run

#### Database logs

- `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetdb/puppetdb.log`
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/postgresql/pgstartup.log`

#### Orchestration logs

- `/var/log/puppetlabs/orchestration-services.log`
- `/var/log/puppetlabs/orchestration-services-daemon.log`: this is where fatal errors or crash reports can be found.


### Tools for working with Puppet Enterprise

PE installs several suites of tools to help you work with the major components of the software. These include:

- **Puppet Tools** --- Tools that control basic functions of Puppet such as `puppet master` and `puppet cert.`
    See the [Tools section](/guides/tools.html) of the Puppet Manual for more information.
- **Puppet orchestrator** --- The Puppet orchestrator is a set of interactive command line tools that provide the interface to the Puppet Application Orchestration service, and also provides you the ability to enforce change on the environment level. These tools include `puppet job` and `puppet app`.  See the [Puppet Orchestrator documentation](./orchestrator_intro.html) for more information. See the [Code Manager documentation](./code_mgr_cli.html) for more information.
- **Puppet Access** --- Puppet Enterprise users can generate tokens to authenticate their access to certain PE command line tools and API endpoints. See the [token-based authentication documentation](./rbac_token_auth.html) for more information.
- **Code Manager CLI** --- The `puppet-code` command allows you to trigger Code Manager from the command line to deploy your environments.   
- **MCollective Tools** --- Tools used to invoke simultaneous actions across a number of nodes. These tools are built on the MCollective framework and are accessed via the `mco` command. See the [PE MCollective documentation](./orchestration_overview.html) for more information.
- **Module Tools** --- The Module tool is used to access and create Puppet Modules, which are reusable chunks of Puppet code users have written to automate configuration and deployment tasks. For more information, and to access modules, visit the [Puppet Forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/).
- **Console** --- The console is Puppet Enterprise's web UI. The console provides tools to view and edit resources on your nodes, view reports and activity graphs, etc. See the [console section](./console_accessing.html) of the PE Manual for more information.

For more details, you can also refer to the man page for a given command or subcommand.

### Services

PE uses the following services:

- **`pe-activemq`** --- The ActiveMQ message server, which passes messages to the MCollective servers on agent nodes. Runs on servers with the Puppet master component.
- **`pe-console-services`** --- Manages and serves the PE console.
- **`pe-puppetserver`** --- The Puppet master server, which manages the Puppet master component.
- **`pe-nginx`** --- Nginx, serves as a reverse-proxy to the PE console.
- **`mcollective`** --- The MCollective daemon, which listens for messages and invokes actions. Runs on every agent node.
- **`puppet`** (on EL and Debian-based platforms) --- The Puppet agent daemon. Runs on every agent node.
- **`pe-puppetdb`** and **`pe-postgresql`** --- Daemons that manage and serve the database components. Note that pe-postgresql is only created if we install and manage PostgreSQL for you.
- **`pe-orchestration-services`** --- Runs the Puppet orchestration process.
- **`pxp-agent`** --- Runs the Puppet agent PXP process.

### User accounts

PE creates the following users:

- **`peadmin`** --- An administrative account which can invoke MCollective-related actions. This is the only PE user account intended for use in a login shell. See [the "Invoking Actions" page of this manual](./orchestration_invoke_cli.html) for more about this user. This user exists on servers with the Puppet master component.
- **`pe-puppet`**  --- A system user that runs the Puppet master processes spawned by pe-puppetserver.
- **`pe-webserver`** --- A system user that runs Nginx (`pe-nginx`).
- **`pe-activemq`** --- A system user that runs the ActiveMQ message bus used by MCollective.
- **`pe-puppetdb`** --- A system user with root access to the database.
- **`pe-postgres`** --- A system user with access to the pe-postgreSQL instance. Note that this user is only created if we install and manage PostgreSQL for you.
- **`pe-console-services`** --- A system user that runs the console process.
- **`pe-orchestration-services`** --- A system user that runs the Puppet Orchestration process.

### Group accounts

PE creates the following groups:

- **`peadmin`** --- An administrative group which can invoke MCollective-related actions.
- **`pe-puppet`** --- A system group that runs the Puppet master processes spawned by pe-puppetserver.
- **`pe-webserver`** --- A system group that runs Nginx (`pe-nginx`).
- **`pe-activemq`** --- A system group that runs the ActiveMQ message bus used by MCollective.
- **`pe-puppetdb`** --- A system group with root access to the database.
- **`pe-postgres`** --- A system group with access to the pe-postgreSQL instance. Note that this group is only created if we install and manage PostgreSQL for you.
- **`pe-console-services`** --- A system group that runs the console process.
- **`pe-orchestration-services`** --- A system group that runs the Puppet Orchestration process.

### Certificates

During install, PE generates the following certificates (can be found at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs`):

- **`<user-entered console certname>`** ---  The certificate for the PE console. Only generated if the user has chosen to install the console in a split component configuration.
- **`<user entered PuppetDB certname>`** ---  The certificate for the database component. Only generated if the user has chosen to install the database in a split component configuration.
- **` <user-entered master certname> `** --- This certificate is either generated at install if the Puppet master and console are the same machine or is signed by the master if the console is on a separate machine.
- **`pe-internal-mcollective-servers`** --- A shared certificate generated on the Puppet master and shared to all agent nodes.
- **`pe-internal-peadmin-mcollective-client`** --- The certificate for the peadmin account on the Puppet master.
- **`pe-internal-puppet-console-mcollective-client`** --- The MCollective certificate for the PE console.
- **`pe-internal-orchestrator`** --- The certificate for the orchestrator service.
- **`pe-internal-classifier`** --- The certificate for the node classifier.
- **`pe-internal-dashboard`** --- The certificate for the PE console.

A fresh PE install should thus give the following list of certificates:

    root@master:~# puppet cert list --all
    + "master"                                        (40:D5:40:FA:E2:94:36:4D:C4:8C:CE:68:FB:77:73:AB) (alt names: "DNS:master", "DNS:puppet", "DNS:puppet.soupkitchen.internal")
    + "pe-internal-classifier"                        F3:57:28:CC:72:2A:8B:75:93:65:27:99:AC:72:B4:AF
    + "pe-internal-dashboard"                         F6:07:C7:E9:33:76:D4:3E:12:D7:77:6D:85:0B:2A:D1
    + "pe-internal-mcollective-servers"               C2:59:69:2E:A1:45:7D:BA:BC:63:71:74:83:03:BF:49
    + "pe-internal-peadmin-mcollective-client"        85:56:72:72:04:02:8E:61:8C:34:B8:53:34:0A:3E:8C
    + "pe-internal-puppet-console-mcollective-client" A1:16:FB:12:9B:3E:85:2A:BF:28:C7:46:A9:8C:E7:55

### Documentation

Man pages for the Puppet subcommands are generated on the fly. To view them, run `puppet man <SUBCOMMAND>`.

The `pe-man` command from previous versions of Puppet Enterprise is no longer functional. Use the above method instead.

Welcome to the writing modules section of the Quick start guide (QSG) series. This document is a short walkthrough to help you become more familiar with Puppet modules, module development, and additional PE features. Follow along to learn how to:

* Create a site module.
* Apply your new module's class to a group with the console.

> Before starting this walkthrough, you should have completed the previous exercises in the [introductory quick start guide](./quick_start.html). You should still be logged in as root or administrator on your nodes.

>Note: This guide assumes that you are **not** using r10k for code management. If you are using r10k, any modules not managed by r10k will be destroyed.

### Prerequisites

First, make sure you have installed the Puppet agent on a node running a [supported version](./install_system_requirements.html#puppet-agent-platforms) of Windows. After the agent is installed, sign its certificate to add it to the console. (You can find instructions for installing Windows agents and signing their certificates in the [Windows agent installation instructions](./quick_start_install_agents_windows.html).

#### Module basics

By default, modules are stored in `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules`. If you're working from a Windows machine, the path is, `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\code
environments\production/modules`. You can configure this path with the [`modulepath`]({{puppet}}/configuration.html#modulepath) setting in `puppet.conf`.

Modules are directory trees. The manifest directory of the Puppet wsus_client module contains the following files:

- `wsus_client/` (the module name)
    - `manifests/`
        - `init.pp` (contains the `wsus_client` class)
        - `service.pp` (defines `wsus_client::service`)

Every manifest (.pp) file contains a single class. File names map to class names in a predictable way: `init.pp` contains a class with the same name as the module; `<NAME>.pp` contains a class called `<MODULE NAME>::<NAME>`; and `<NAME>/<OTHER NAME>.pp` contains `<MODULE NAME>::<NAME>::<OTHER NAME>`.

Many modules contain directories other than `manifests`; for simplicity's sake, we do not cover them in this introductory guide.

### Write a Puppet module

Puppet modules save time, but at some point most users also need to write their own modules.

#### Writing a class in a module

During this exercise, you create a class called `critical_policy` that manages a collection of important settings and options in your Windows registry, most notably the legal caption and text users see before the login screen.

1. **On the Puppet master**, make sure you're still in the modules directory, `cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules`, and then run `mkdir -p critical_policy/manifests` to create the new module directory and its manifests directory.
2. Use your text editor to create and open the `critical_policy/manifests/init.pp` file.
3. Edit the init.pp file so it contains the following Puppet code, and then save it and exit the editor:

        class critical_policy {

          registry::value { 'Legal notice caption':
            key   => 'HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System',
            value => 'legalnoticecaption',
            data  => 'Legal Notice',
            }

          registry::value { 'Legal notice text':
            key   => 'HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System',
            value => 'legalnoticetext',
            data  => 'Login constitutes acceptance of the End User Agreement',
            }
          }

You have written a new module containing a single class. Puppet now knows about this class, and it can be added to the console and assigned to your Windows nodes.

Note the following about this new class:

 * The `registry::value` defined resource type allows you to use Puppet to manage the parent key for a particular value automatically.
 * The `key` parameter specifies the path the key the value(s) must be in.
 * The `value` parameter lists the name of the registry value(s) to manage. This is copied from the resource title if not specified.
 * The `type` parameter determines the type of the registry value(s). Defaults to 'string'. Valid values are 'string', 'array', 'dword', 'qword', 'binary', or 'expand'.
 * `data` Lists the data inside the registry value.

* For short, printable references, see [the modules cheat sheet](/module_cheat_sheet.pdf) and [the core types cheat sheet](/puppet_core_types_cheatsheet.pdf).

### Use your custom module in the console

[legal_notice_text_larry]: ./images/quick/legal_notice_larry.png
[legal_notice_text_values]: ./images/quick/legal_notice_values.png

1. **On the console,** click **Nodes** > **Classification**, and then select the node group you want to add your module to (e.g., Windows_example).
2. Click the **Classes** tab, and in the **Add new class** box, type or choose `critical_policy`. You might need to wait a moment or two for the class to show up in the list. You can also click **Refresh**.
2. Click **Add class** and the commit change button.

### Test out your module

1. **On the Windows agent node**, manually set the data values of `legalnoticecaption` and `legalnoticetext` to some other values. For example, set `legalnoticecaption` to "Larry's Computer" and set `legalnoticetext` to "This is Larry's computer."

   ![Legal notice text larry][legal_notice_text_larry]

2. **On the Windows agent node,** refresh the registry and note that the values of `legalnoticecaption` and `legalnoticetext` have been returned to the values specified in your `critical_policy` manifest.

   ![Legal notice text original value][legal_notice_text_values]

If you reboot your Windows machine, you will see the legal caption and text before you log in again.

You have created a new class from scratch and used it to manage registry settings on your Windows server.

### Using a site module

Many users create a "site" module. Instead of describing smaller units of a configuration, the classes in a site module describe a complete configuration for a given _type_ of machine. For example, a site module might contain:

* A `site::basic` class, for nodes that require security management but haven't been given a specialized role yet.
* A `site::webserver` class for nodes that serve web content.
* A `site::dbserver` class for nodes that provide a database server to other applications.

Site modules hide complexity so you can more easily divide labor at your site. System architects can create the site classes, and junior admins can create new machines and assign a single "role" class to them in the console. In this workflow, the console controls policy, not fine-grained implementation.

* **On the Puppet master,** create the `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/site/manifests/basic.pp` file by running `mkdir -p site/manifests`. Then, edit it to contain the following:


        class site::basic {
          if $osfamily == 'windows' {
            include critical_policy
          }
          else {
            include motd
            include core_permissions
          }
        }
* Run `puppet agent -t` to ensure `site::basic` is created.

This class declares other classes with the `include` function. Note the "if" conditional that sets different classes for different OS's using the `$osfamily` fact. In this example, if an agent node is not a Windows agent, Puppet applies the `motd` and `core_permissions` classes. For more information about declaring classes, see the [modules and classes chapters of Learning Puppet](/learning/modules1.html).

1. **On the console,** remove all of the previous example classes from your nodes and groups (e.g., `wsus_client` and `critical_policy`). Be sure to leave the `pe_*` classes in place.
2. Add the `site::basic` class to the console with **_Add new class**.
3. Assign the `site::basic` class to the **windows_example** group.

> Your nodes are now receiving the same configurations as before, but with a simplified interface in the console. Instead of deciding which classes a new node should receive, you can decide what _type_ of node it is and take advantage of decisions you made earlier.


### Summary

You have now performed the core workflows of an intermediate Puppet user. In the course of their normal work, intermediate users:

* Download and modify Forge modules to fit their deployment's needs.
* Create new modules and write new classes to manage many types of resources, including files, services, packages, user accounts, and more.
* Build and curate a site module to safely empower junior admins and simplify the decisions involved in deploying new machines.
* Monitor and troubleshoot events that affect their infrastructure.

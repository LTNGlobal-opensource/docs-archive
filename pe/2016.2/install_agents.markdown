If you have a supported OS that is capable of using remote package repos, the simplest way to install the PE agent is with standard *nix package management tools.

> ### Installing Windows agents?

> Windows cannot be installed using the package management instructions outlined below.
>
> To install the agent on a node running the Windows OS, refer to the [installing Windows agent instructions](./install_windows.html).

## About PE package management

>**Warning**: Installing agents using the `pe_repo` class requires an internet connection. If you don't have access to the internet, refer to [installing agents in a Puppet Enterprise infrastructure without internet access](#installing-agents-in-a-puppet-enterprise-infrastructure-without-internet-access).

PE hosts a package repo on the master that corresponds to the OS and architecture of the Puppet master node. The repo is created during installation of the Puppet master. The repo serves packages over HTTPS using the same port as the Puppet master (8140). This means agents won't require any new ports to be open other than the one they already need to communicate with the Puppet master.

You can also add repos for any PE-supported OS and architecture by creating a new repository for that platform.

### How the platform-specific install script works

The `install.bash` script actually uses a secondary script to retrieve and install an agent package repo once it has detected the platform on which it is running. You can use this secondary script if you want to manually specify the platform of the agent packages. You can also use this script as an example or as the basis for your own custom scripts.

The script can be found at `https://<master hostname>:8140/packages/current/<PLATFORM>.bash`, where `<PLATFORM>` uses the form `el-6-x86_64`. Platform names are the same as those used for the PE tarballs:

     - el-{5, 6}-{i386, x86_64}
     - debian-{6, 7}-{i386, amd64}
     - ubuntu-{10.04, 12.04}-{i386, amd64}
     - sles-11-{i386, x86_64}
     
When you run the install script, it detects the OS on which it is running, sets up an apt, yum, or zipper repo that refers back to the Puppet master, and then pulls down and installs the `puppet-agent` packages. It also creates a basic `puppet.conf`, and kicks off a Puppet run.

Note that if the install script can't find agent packages corresponding to the agent's platform, it will fail with an error message telling you which `pe_repo` class you need to add to the master.

> **Warning**: If the Puppet master and agent differ in architecture and OS type/version, the correct `pe_repo` class for the agent must be assigned to the Puppet master node before running the script. If you have not added the correct agent class and run the script, you'll get an HTTP 404 error message. This error is safe to ignore, but you need to add the correct `pe_repo` class for the agent to the Puppet master before running the script again.

## Installing Puppet Agents with the Package Installation Script

>**Note**: The `<MASTER HOSTNAME>` portion of the installer script--as provided in the following examples--refers to the FQDN of the Puppet master. In a monolithic install, this is the same node on which you installed the Puppet master, console, and PuppetDB components; in a split install, this is the node you assigned to the Puppet master component. Note that if you've already logged into the console, you can find the exact script with the correct master hostname for your installation by clicking on **node requests** in the top right-hand corner of the console. (You do not need to have pending node requests to click.)

### Scenario 1: The OS/architecture of the Puppet master and the agent node are the same

1. SSH into the node where you want to install the PE agent, and run `curl -k https://<MASTER HOSTNAME>:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash`.

   >**Tips**: see [passing configuration parameters to the install script](#passing-configuration-parameters-to-the-install-script)     to specify configuration settings, such as specifying a cert name, which will be added to `puppet.conf`.
   >
   >You can replace `current` in the script with a specific PE version number, in the form of `2016.x.x`.

   >**Tip:** If you can't use `curl -k` to install agents as shown in the following procedures, refer to the [instructions on using `curl` against the Puppet master CA cert](#optional-install-agents-without-curl-k).

After the installation is complete, continue on to [signing agent certificates](#signing-agent-certificates).

### Scenario 2: The OS/architecture of the Puppet master and the agent node are different

[classification]: ./images/quick/classification.png

To install an agent with a different OS than the Puppet master, you add the appropriate class for the repo that contains the agent packages, and you classify the PE Master node group with that class. You then run the install script from the agent to retrieve the necessary packages for installation.

As an example, if your Puppet master is on a node running EL6 and you want to add an agent node running Debian 6 on AMD64 hardware, use the follow procedure.

> **Note**: If your Puppet master uses a proxy server to access the internet, refer to [this known issue](./release_notes_known_issues_install.html#install-agents-with-different-os-when-puppet-master-is-behind-a-proxy) for a workaround.

1. In the console, click __Nodes__ > __Classification__.

2. Select the __PE Masters__ group.

3. Click the __Classes__ tab.

4. In the __Class name__ field, begin typing `pe_repo`, and select the repo class from the list of classes.

   >**Note**: the repo classes are listed as `pe_repo::platform::<AGENT_OS_VERSION_ARCHITECTURE>`

5. Click __Add class__.

6. Click __Commit 1 change__.

   >**Note**: The `pe_repo::platform::debian_6_amd_64` class now appears in the list of classes for the __PE Masters__ group, but it has not yet been configured on your nodes. For that to happen, you need to kick off a Puppet run.

7. Run `puppet agent -t` to configure the Puppet master node using the newly assigned class.

   The new repo is created in `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public/<PE VERSION>/<PLATFORM>/`.

8. SSH into the Debian node where you want to install the agent, and run `curl -k https://<master.example.com>:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash`.

    The script will install the PE agent packages, create a basic `puppet.conf`, and kick off a Puppet run.

   >**Tip**: see [Passing Configuration Parameters to the Install Script](#passing-configuration-parameters-to-the-install-script) to specify configuration settings, such as specifying a cert name, which will be added to `puppet.conf`.

   >**Note**: The `-k` flag is needed in order to get `curl` to trust the master, which it wouldn't otherwise since Puppet and its SSL infrastructure have not yet been set up on the node.
>
>However, users of AIX 5.3, 6.1, and 7.1 should note that the `-k` is not supported. You should replace the `-k` flag with `-tlsv1` or `-1`.
>
>In some cases, you may be using `wget` instead of `curl`---please use the appropriate flags as needed.

9. After the installation is complete, continue on to [Signing Agent Certificates](#signing-agent-certificates).

### Passing configuration parameters to the install script

ON *nix-based systems, you can pass parameters to the end of the install script to specify configuration settings, such as specifying a cert name, which will be added to `puppet.conf`. In this case you would run, `curl -k https://master.example.com:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash -s agent:certname=<certnameotherthanFQDN>`.

You can pass as many parameters as you need to; be sure to follow the `section:key=value` pattern and just leave one space between parameters. Vist the [Configuration Reference]({{puppet}}/configuration.html) for a complete list of values.

### (Optional) Install agents without `curl -k`

In the instructions for installing agents with PE package management, the `-k` flag is needed in order to get `curl` to trust the master, which it wouldn't otherwise since Puppet and its SSL infrastructure have not yet been set up on the node. 

If you choose not to use `curl -k`, you can transfer the Puppet master CA certificate to any machines you want to install agents on, and then run the installation script against that cert. 

1. On the machine that will become the agent node, create the following directory: `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs`.
2. On the Puppet master, navigate to `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/` and transfer `ca.pem` to the directory you made on the agent node in the previous step.    
3. On the agent node, make sure the file permissions are correct.

   ~~~
   chmod 444 /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem
   ~~~
   
4. When following the agent install instructions, use the --cacert flag to point to the Puppet master CA.

   ~~~
   curl --cacert /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem https://<PUPPET MASTER HOSTNAME>:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash
   ~~~

See the [system requirements](./sys_req_os.html#aix) for more information about AIX, curl, and OpenSSL.

Users of AIX 5.3, 6.1, and 7.1 should note that the `-k` is not supported. You should replace the `-k` flag with `-tlsv1` or `-1`.

In some cases, you may be using `wget` instead of `curl`---please use the appropriate flags as needed.

## Installing agents in a Puppet Enterprise infrastructure without internet access

When installing agents on a platform that is different from the Puppet master platform, the agent install script attempts to connect to the internet to download the appropriate agent package after you classify the Puppet master, as described in [installing agents using PE package management](#installing-puppet-agents-with-the-package-installation-script).

If your PE infrastructure does not have access to the outside internet, you will not be able to fully use the agent installation instructions. Instead, [download](http://puppetlabs.com/misc/pe-files/agent-downloads) the appropriate agent package in advance and use the option below that corresponds to your deployment needs.

* **Option 1**

    If you would like to use the PE-provided repo, you can copy the agent package into the `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/staging/pe_repo-<PUPPET-AGENT-VERSION>` directory on your master, and then follow the steps in [using the Puppet agent package installation script](#installing-puppet-agents-with-the-package-installation-script) to complete the process.

    Note that if you upgrade your server at any point, you'll need to perform this task again for the new version.

* **Option 2**

    If you already have a package management/distribution system, you can use it to install agents by adding the agent packages to your own repo. In this case, you can disable the PE-hosted repo feature altogether by [removing](./console_classes_groups_making_changes.html#removing-classes-from-a-node-group) the `pe_repo` class from your master, along with any class that starts with `pe_repo::`.

    Note that if you upgrade your server, you'll need to perform this task again for the new version.

* **Option 3**

    If your deployment has multiple masters and you don't wish to copy the agent package to each one, you can specify a path to the agent package. This can be done by [using the console](./console_classes_groups.html#defining-the-data-used-by-classes) to set the `base_path` parameter of the `pe_repo` class to an accessible server containing the agent package.

## Installing agents using your package management tools

If you are currently using native package management, perform the following steps:

1. Add the agent packages to the appropriate repo.

2. Configure your package manager (yum, apt) to point to that repo.

3. Install the packages as you would any other packages.

Agent packages can be found on the Puppet master, in `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public/<PE VERSION>/`. This directory contains the platform specific repository file structure for agent packages. By default this will contain a repository matching your Puppet master's OS/architecture. For example, if your Puppet master is running on CentOS 7, in `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public/<PE VERSION>/`, you will find the directory `el-7-x86_64`, which contains the directories with all the packages needed to install an agent.

If your nodes are running an OS and/or architecture that is different from the master, [download the appropriate agent package](http://puppetlabs.com/misc/pe-files/agent-downloads), extract the agent packages into the appropriate repo, and then install the agents on your nodes just as you would any other package (e.g., `yum install puppet-agent`).

Alternatively, if you have internet access to your master node, you can follow the instructions above and [use the console](#installing-puppet-agents-with-the-package-installation-script) to classify the master with one of the built-in `pe_repo::platform::<PLATFORM>` classes. After you classify the Puppet master and a Puppet run has occurred, the appropriate agent packages will be generated and stored in `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public/<PE VERSION>`. If your Puppet master does not have internet access, download the agents manually, and choose an option from [installing agents in a Puppet Enterprise infrastructure without internet access](#installing-agents-in-a-puppet-enterprise-infrastructure-without-internet-access).

After you've installed the agent on the target node, you can configure it using `puppet config set`. See "[configuring agents](#configuring-agents)" below.

## Signing agent certificates

Before nodes with the Puppet agent component can fetch configurations or appear in the console, an administrator needs to sign their certificate requests. This helps prevent unauthorized nodes from intercepting sensitive configuration data.

After the first Puppet run, which the installer should trigger at the end of installation (or it can be triggered manually with `puppet agent -t`), the agent will automatically submit a certificate request to the Puppet master. Before the agent can retrieve any configurations, a user will have to approve this certificate.

Node requests can be approved or rejected using the console. Pending node requests are indicated in the main navigation bar.

**To sign certificates using the console**:

1. From the console, click **Nodes** > **Unsigned Certificates** to load a list of currently pending node requests.

2. Click the __Accept All__ button to approve all the requests and add the nodes.

Alternatively, you can use the command line interface (CLI), but note that **certificate signing with the CLI is done on the Puppet master node**. To view the list of pending certificate requests, run:

    $ sudo puppet cert list

To sign one of the pending requests, run:

    $ sudo puppet cert sign <name>

After signing a new node's certificate, it may take up to 30 minutes before that node appears in the console and begins retrieving configurations. You can use the CLI to trigger a Puppet run manually on the node if you want to see it right away.

If you need to remove certificates (e.g., during reinstallation of a node), you can use the `puppet cert clean <node name>` command.

## Configuring agents

After you sign its certificate, your agent should be ready for management with PE. However, if you need to perform additional configurations you can do so by editing `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf` directly, or by using [the `puppet config set` sub-command][config_set], which will edit `puppet.conf` automatically.

For example, to point the agent at a Puppet master called "master.example.com," run `puppet config set server master.example.com`. This will add the setting `server = puppetmaster.example.com` to the `[main]` section of `puppet.conf`. To set the certname for the agent, run `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet config set certname agent.example.com`. For more details, see [the documentation for `puppet config set`][config_set].

>**Warning for Mac OS X users**: When performing a command line install of an agent on an OS X system, you must run  `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet config set server` and `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet config set certname` for the agent to function correctly.

## A note about binaries and symlinks

Refer to [Puppet Enterprise binaries and symlinks](./install_basic.html#puppet-enterprise-binaries-and-symlinks) for information about the binaries and symlinks PE sets. You can also find instructions on disabling the symlinks.

## Preparing agents for orchestration services

If you have agents that will participate in Orchestration services, there are additional configuration steps you need to perform. For full instructions, see [enable cached catalogs for orchestration services](./orchestrator_install.html#enable-cached-catalogs-for-orchestration-services).

[config_set]: {{puppet}}/config_set.html

>**Tip**: After you finish installing your agents, follow the instructions in the [NTP Quick Start Guide](./quick_start_ntp.html) to have PE ensure time is in sync across your deployment.

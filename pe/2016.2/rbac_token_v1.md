## Authentication tokens

A user's access to PE services can be controlled using authentication tokens. Users can generate their own authentication tokens using the `token` endpoint.

### POST /auth/token

Generate an access token for the user whose login information is POSTed. This token is a JWT token that is signed by the RBAC server to prevent tampering. This token can then be used to authenticate requests to PE services using either the `X-Authentication` header or the `token` query parameter. For more information about generating and using authentication tokens to access PE services, see the [token-based authentication](./rbac_token_auth.html) documentation.

> **Note:** For security reasons, authentication tokens can only be generated for revocable users. The admin user and api_user cannot be revoked.

**Example request using cURL on an agent node:**

```
`curl –cacert $(puppet config print cacert) -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"login": "<YOUR PE USER NAME>", "password": "<YOUR PE PASSWORD>"}' https://<HOSTNAME>:4433/rbac-api/v1/auth/token`
```

The parts of this cURL request are explained below:
   
   * `–cacert [FILE]`: Specifies a CA certificate as described in [Forming requests for the node classifier](./nc_forming_requests.html#authentication). Alternatively, you could use the `-k` flag to turn off SSL verification of the RBAC server so that you can use the HTTPS protocol without providing a CA cert. If you do not provide one of these options in your cURL request, cURL complains about not being able to verify the RBAC server.
   
   > **Note:** The `-k` flag is shown as an example only. You should use your own discretion when choosing the appropriate server verification method for the tool that you are using. 
   
   * `-X POST`: This is an HTTP POST request to provide your login information to the RBAC service.
   * `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'`: sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`, which indicates to RBAC that the data being sent is in JSON format..
   * `-d '{"login": "<YOUR PE USER NAME>", "password": "<YOUR PE PASSWORD>"}'`: Provide the user name and password that you use to log in to the PE console. 
   * `https://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/rbac-api/v1/auth/token`: Sends the request to the `token` endpoint. For `HOSTNAME`, provide the FQDN of the server that is hosting the PE console service. If you are making the call from the console server, you can use "localhost." For `PORT`, provide the port that the PE services (node classifier service, RBAC service, and activity service) listen on. The default port is 4433.
   
**Token endpoint keys:**

`lifetime`: If you have the [permission to change a token's lifetime value](./rbac_token_auth.html#setting-a-token-specific-lifetime), you can specify the expiration time when generating a token. You can specify a numeric value followed by "y" (years), "d" (days), "h" (hours), "m" (minutes), or "s"(seconds). For example, a value of "12h" is 12 hours. Do not add a space between the numeric value and the unit of measurement. If you do not specify a unit, it is assumed to be seconds. If you do not want the token to expire, set the lifetime to "0". Setting it to zero gives the token a lifetime of approximately ten years.

**Note:** The default lifetime for all tokens is also configurable. For information on changing the default lifetime, see [Changing the default lifetime](./rbac_token_auth.html#changing-the-default-lifetime).

Example request when specifying a token-specific expiration:

```
`curl –cacert $(puppet config print cacert) -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"login": "<YOUR PE USER NAME>", "password": "<YOUR PE PASSWORD>", "lifetime": "4m"}' https://<HOSTNAME>:4433/rbac-api/v1/auth/token`
```

**Returns:**

* "200 OK" if the credentials are good and the user is not revoked.
* "401 Unauthenticated" if the credentials are bad or the user is revoked.
* "400 Malformed" if something is wrong with the request body

**Example return:**

    {"token": "asd0u0=2jdijasodj-w0duwdhjashd,kjsahdasoi0d9hw0hduashd0a9wdy0whdkaudhaksdhc9chakdh92..."}

# Next Steps

After you've worked through the Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) getting started steps, you can now perform the core workflows of a Puppet user.

To continue learning, take the following next steps:

-   Read about the different ways you can use Puppet to [manage your Windows configurations](managing_windows_configurations.md#).

-   Learn more about [Windows modules](installing_and_using_windows_modules.md#) and working with the Forge.

-   Use the [roles and profiles](designing_convenient_roles.md#) method to create a complete system configuration and store it in a control repository.

-   Manage Puppet code using PE [Code Manager](managing_puppet_code.md) tools and a control repository.

-   Classify nodes using [groups and rules](grouping_and_classifying_nodes.md#).

# Configuration options

There are various configuration options for the RBAC service. Each section can exist in its own file or in separate files.

## RBAC service configuration

You can configure the RBAC service's settings to specify the duration before inactive user accounts expire, adjust the length of user sessions, the number of times a user can attempt to log in, and the length of time a password reset token is valid. You can also define a whitelist of certificates.

These configuration parameters are not required, but when present must be under the `rbac` section, as in the following example:

```
rbac: {
  # Duration in days before an inactive account expires
  account-expiry-days: 1
  # Duration in minutes that idle user accounts are checked
  account-expiry-check-minutes: 60
  # Duration in hours that a password reset token is viable
  password-reset-expiration: 24
  # Duration in minutes that a session is viable
  session-timeout: 60
  failed-attempts-lockout: 10
}
```

### account-expiry-days

This parameter is a positive integer that specifies the duration, in days, before an inactive user account expires. The default value is undefined. To activate this feature, add a value of 1 or greater.

If a non-superuser hasn't logged into the console during this specified period, their user status updates to revoked. After creating an account, if a non-superuser hasn't logged in to the console during the specified period, their user status updates to revoked.

**Important:** If the `account-expiry-days` parameter is not specified, or has a value of less than 1, the `account-expiry-check-minutes` parameter is ignored.

### account-expiry-check-minutes

This parameter is a positive integer that specifies how often, in minutes, the application checks for idle user accounts. The default value is 60 minutes.

### password-reset-expiration

When a user doesn't remember their current password, an administrator can generate a token for them to change their password. The duration, in hours, that this generated token is valid can be changed with the `password-reset-expiration` config parameter. The default value is 24.

### session-timeout

This parameter is a positive integer that specifies how long a user's session should last, in minutes. This session is the same across node classifier, RBAC, and the console. The default value is 60.

### failed-attempts-lockout

This parameter is a positive integer that specifies how many failed login attempts are allowed on an account before that account is revoked. The default value is 10.

**Note:** If you change this value, create a new file or Puppet resets back to 10 when it next runs. Create the file in an RBAC section of `/etc/puppetlabs/console-services/conf.d`.

### certificate-whitelist

This parameter is a path for specifying the file that contains the names of hosts that are allowed to use RBAC APIs and other downstream component APIs, such as the Node Classifier and the Activity services. This configuration is for the users who want to script interaction with the RBAC service.

Users must connect to the RBAC service with a client certificate that has been specified in this `certificate-whitelist` file. A successful match of the client certificate and this certificate-whitelist allows access to the RBAC APIs as the api\_user. By default, this user is an administrator and has all available permissions.

The certificate whitelist contains, at minimum, the certificate for the nodes PE is installed on.

## RBAC database configuration

Credential information for the RBAC service is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

The configuration information for that database is found in the 'rbac-database' section of the config.

For example:

```
rbac-database: {
  classname: org.postgresql.Driver
  subprotocol: postgresql
  subname: "//<path-to-host>:5432/perbac"
  user: <username here>
  password: <password here>
}
```

### classname

Used by the RBAC service for connecting to the database; this option should always be `org.postgresql.Driver`.

### subprotocol

Used by the RBAC service for connecting to the database; this options should always be `postgresql`.

### subname

JDBC connection path used by the RBAC service for connecting to the database. This should be set to the hostname and configured port of the PostgreSQL database. `perbac` is the database the RBAC service uses to store credentials.

### user

This is the username the RBAC service should use to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

### password

This is the password the RBAC service should use to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

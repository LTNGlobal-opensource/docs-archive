# Running tasks from the command line

Use the `puppet task run` command to run tasks on agent nodes.

## Before you begin

The first time you run a command, you need to authenticate. See the [orchestrator installation instructions](configuring_puppet_orchestrator.md#) for information about setting RBAC permissions and token authorization.

If you're running this command from a managed or non-managed Windows workstation, you must specify the full path to the command. For example, `c:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\Client\bin\puppet-task run`.

Install the tasks you want to use.

Make sure you have permission to run the tasks on all nodes.

Make sure you have permission to run the tasks.

Make sure you have access to the nodes you want to target.

Make sure you have permissions to run tasks and PQL queries.

Make sure you have permissions to run jobs and PQL queries.

## About this task

Use the `puppet task` tool and the relevant module to make changes arbitrarily, rather than through a Puppet configuration change. For example, to inspect a package or quickly stop a particular service.

You can run tasks on a single node, on nodes identified in a static list, on nodes retrieved by a PQL query, or on nodes in a node group.

Use the orchestrator command `puppet task` to trigger task runs.

## Results

## Run a task on a PQL query

Create a PQL query to run tasks on nodes that meet specific conditions.

### Before you begin

Install the tasks you want to use.

Make sure you have access to the nodes you want to target.

Make sure you have permissions to run tasks and PQL queries.

### About this task

### Procedure

1.  Log into your master or client tools workstation and run one of the following commands:

    -   To specify the query on the command line: `puppet task run <TASK NAME> <PARAMETER>=<VALUE>, <PARAMETER>=<VALUE> --query '<QUERY>' <OPTIONS>`
    -   To pass the query in a text file: `puppet task run <TASK NAME> <PARAMETER>=<VALUE>, <PARAMETER>=<VALUE> --query @/path/to/file.txt`
    For example, to run the service task with two required parameters, on nodes with "web" in their certname:

    ```
    puppet task run service action=status service=nginx --query 'nodes {certname ~ "web" }'
    ```

    **Tip:** Use `puppet task show <TASK NAME>` to see a list of available parameters for a task. Not all tasks require parameters. Parameters passed inline as `<PARAMETER>=<VALUE>` will be treated as strings.

    Refer to the `puppet task` command options to see how to pass parameters, particularly non-strings, with the `--params` flag.

    The following table shows some example targets and the associated PQL queries you could run with the orchestrator.

    Be sure to wrap the entire query in single quotes and use double quotes inside the query.

    |Target|PQL query|
    |------|---------|
    |Single node by certname|`--query 'nodes { certname = "mynode" }'`|
    |All nodes with "web" in certname|`--query 'nodes { certname ~ "web" }'`|
    |All CentOS nodes|`--query 'inventory { facts.os.name = "CentOS" }'`|
    |All CentOS nodes with httpd managed|`--query 'inventory { facts.operatingsystem = "CentOS" and resources { type = "Service" and title = "httpd" } }'`|
    |All nodes with failed reports|`--query 'reports { latest_report? = true and status = "failed" }'`|
    |All nodes matching the environment for the last received catalog|`--query 'nodes { catalog_environment = "production" }'`|

    **Tip:** You can use `-q` in place of `--query`.


## Run a task on a list of nodes or a single node

Use a node list target when you need to run a job on a set of nodes that doesn't easily resolve to a PQL query. Use a single node or a comma-separated list of nodes.

### Before you begin

Install the tasks you want to use.

Make sure you have access to the nodes you want to target.

Make sure you have permissions to run tasks and PQL queries.

### Procedure

1.  Log into your master or client tools workstation and run one of the following commands:

    -   To run a task job on a single node: `puppet task run <TASK NAME> <PARAMETER>=<VALUE>, <PARAMETER>=<VALUE> --nodes <NODE NAME> <OPTIONS>`
    -   To run a task job on a list of nodes, use a comma-separated list of node names: `puppet task run <TASK NAME> <PARAMETER>=<VALUE>, <PARAMETER>=<VALUE> --nodes <NODE NAME>,<NODE NAME>,<NODE NAME>,<NODE NAME> <OPTIONS>`

        **Note:** Do not add spaces in the list of nodes.

    -   To run a task job on a node list from a text file: `puppet task run <TASK NAME> <PARAMETER>=<VALUE>, <PARAMETER>=<VALUE> --nodes @/path/to/file.txt`

        **Note:** In the text file, put each node on a separate line.

    For example, to run the service task with two required parameters, on three specific nodes: 

    ```
    puppet task run service action=status service=nginx --nodes host1,host2,host3
    ```

    **Tip:** Use `puppet task show <TASK NAME>` to see a list of available parameters for a task. Not all tasks require parameters. Parameters passed inline as `<PARAMETER>=<VALUE>` will be treated as strings.

    Refer to the `puppet task` command options to see how to pass parameters, particularly non-strings, with the `--params` flag.


## Run a task on a node group

Similar to running a task on a list of nodes, you can run a task on a node group.

### Before you begin

Install the tasks you want to use.

Make sure you have access to the nodes you want to target.

### About this task

### Procedure

1.  Log into your master or client tools workstation.

2.  Run the command: `puppet task run <TASK NAME> --node-group <node-group-id>`

    **Tip:** Use the` /v1/groups` endpoint to retrieve a list node groups and their IDs.

## `puppet task run` command options

The following are common options you use with the `task` action. For a complete list of global options run `puppet task --help`.

|Option|Value|Description|
|------|-----|-----------|
|`--noop`|Flag, default false|Run a task to simulate changes without actually enforcing the changes.|
|`--params`|String|Specify a JSON object that includes the parameters, or specify the path to a JSON file containing the parameters, prefaced with `@`, for example, `@/path/to/file.json`. Do not use this flag if specifying parameter-value pairs inline; see more information below.|
|`--environment`, `-e`|Environment name|Use tasks installed in the specified environment.|
|`--description`|Flag, defaults to empty|Provide a description for the job, to be shown on the job list and job details pages, and returned with the `puppet job show` command.|

You can pass parameters into the task one of two ways:

-   Inline, using the `<PARAMETER>=<VALUE>` syntax:

```
puppet task run <TASK NAME> <PARAMETER>=<VALUE>, <PARAMETER>=<VALUE> --nodes <LIST OF NODES> 
puppet task run my_task action=status service=my_service timeout=8 --nodes host1,host2,host3
```

**Important:** All parameters passed inline will be treated as strings. If you want, for example, `timeout=8` to be passed as an integer, use the `--params` option.

-   With the `--params` option, as a JSON object or reference to a JSON file:

```
puppet task run <TASK NAME> --params '<JSON OBJECT>' --nodes <LIST OF NODES> 
puppet task run my_task --params '{ "action":"status", "service":"my_service", "timeout":8 }' --nodes host1,host2,host3 
puppet task run my_task --params @/path/to/file.json --nodes host1,host2,host3
```


You can't combine these two methods of passing in parameters; choose either inline or `--params`. If you use the inline method, all parameters are passed as strings. Use the `--params` method if you want them read as their original type.

## Reviewing task job output

The output the orchestrator returns depends on the type of task you run. Output is either standard output \(STDOUT\) or structured output. At minimum, the orchestrator prints a new job ID and the number of nodes in the task.

The following example shows a task to check the status of the Puppet service running on a list of nodes derived from a PQL query.

```
[example@orch-master ~]$ puppet task run service service=puppet action=status -q 'nodes {certname ~ "br"}' --environment=production
Starting job ...
New job ID: 2029
Nodes: 8

Started on bronze-11 ...
Started on bronze-8 ...
Started on bronze-3 ...
Started on bronze-6 ...
Started on bronze-2 ...
Started on bronze-5 ...
Started on bronze-7 ...
Started on bronze-10 ...
Finished on node bronze-11
  status : running
  enabled : true
Finished on node bronze-3
  status : running
  enabled : true
Finished on node bronze-8
  status : running
  enabled : true
Finished on node bronze-7
  status : running
  enabled : true
Finished on node bronze-2
  status : running
  enabled : true
Finished on node bronze-6
  status : running
  enabled : true
Finished on node bronze-5
  status : running
  enabled : true
Finished on node bronze-10
  status : running
  enabled : true

Job completed. 8/8 nodes succeeded.
Duration: 1 sec
	 
```

**Tip:** To view the status of all running, completed, and failed jobs run the `puppet job show` command, or view them from the Job details page in the console.

## Inspect tasks

View the tasks that you have installed and have permission to run, as well as the documentation for those tasks.

### Before you begin

The first time you run a command, you need to authenticate. See the [orchestrator installation instructions](configuring_puppet_orchestrator.md#) for information about setting RBAC permissions and token authorization.

If you're running this command from a managed or non-managed Windows workstation, you must specify the full path to the command. For example, `c:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\Client\bin\puppet-task run`.

Install the tasks you want to use.

Make sure you have permission to run the tasks on all nodes.

Make sure you have permission to run the tasks.

Make sure you have access to the nodes you want to target.

Make sure you have permissions to run tasks and PQL queries.

Make sure you have permissions to run jobs and PQL queries.

### About this task

Install the tasks you want to use.

Make sure you have permissions to run tasks and PQL queries.

### Procedure

1.  Log into your master or client tools workstation and run one of the following commands:

    -   To check the documentation for a specific task: `puppet task show <TASK>`. The command returns the following:
        -   The command format for running the task
        -   Any parameters available to use with the task
    -   To view a list of your permitted tasks: `puppet task show`
    -   To view a list of all installed tasks pass the `--all` flag: `puppet task show --all`

## Stop a job in progress

You can stop a job if, for example, you realize you need to reconfigure a class or push a configuration change that the job needs.

### About this task

When you stop an on-demand Puppet run, runs that are underway finish, and runs that have not started are canceled.

Stopping tasks depends on how many nodes are targeted in the job versus the concurrency limit you've set. If the concurrency limit is higher than the number of nodes targeted, all nodes complete the task, as those nodes have already started the task.

### Procedure

1.  To stop a job:

    -   In the console, go to the **Job details** page and select the **Puppet run** or **Task** tab. From the list of jobs, find the one you want and click **Stop**.
    -   On the command line, press **CTRL + C**.

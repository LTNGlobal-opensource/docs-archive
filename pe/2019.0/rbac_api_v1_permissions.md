# Permissions endpoints

You assign permissions to user roles to manage user access to objects. The `permissions` endpoints enable you to get information about available objects and the permissions that can be constructed for those objects.

## Permissions keys

The following keys are used with the RBAC v1 APIâ€™s permissions endpoints. The available values for these keys are available from the `/types` endpoint \(see below\).

|Key|Explanation|Example|
|---|-----------|-------|
|`object_type`|A string identifying the type of object this permission applies to.|`"node_groups"`|
|`action`|A string indicating the type of action this permission permits.|`"modify_children"`|
|`instance`|A string containing the primary ID of the object instance this permission applies to, or `"*"` indicating that it applies to all instances. If the given action does not allow instance specification, `"*"` should always be used.|`"cec7e830-555b-11e4-916c-0800200c9a66"` or `"*"`|

## GET /types

Lists the objects that integrate with RBAC and demonstrates the permissions that can be constructed by picking the appropriate `object_type`, `action`, and `instance` triple. Authentication is required.

The `has_instances` flag indicates that the action permission is instance-specific if `true`, or `false` if this action permission does not require instance specification.

### Response format

Returns a 200 OK response with a listing of types.

For example:

```json
[{ "object_type": "node_groups",
   "display_name": "Node Groups",
   "description": "Groups that nodes can be assigned to."
   "actions": [{ "name": "view",
                 "display_name": "View",
                 "description": "View the node groups",
                 "has_instances": true
                },{
                 "name":"modify",
                 "display_name": "Configure",
                 "description": "Modify description, variables and classes",
                 "has_instances": true
                }, ...]
 },...]
```

### Error responses

Returns a 401 Unauthorized response if no user is logged in.

Returns a 403 Forbidden response if the current user lacks permissions to view the types.

## POST /permitted

Checks an array of permissions for the subject identified by the submitted identifier.

### Request format

This endpoint takes a "token" in the form of a user or a user group's UUID and a list of permissions. This returns true or false for each permission queried, representing whether the subject is permitted to take the given action.

The full evaluation of permissions is taken into account, including inherited roles and matching general permissions against more specific queries. For example, a query for `users:edit:1` returns `true` if the subject has `users:edit:1` or `users:edit:*`.

In the following example, the first permission is querying whether the subject specified by the token is permitted to perform the `edit_rules` action on the instance of `node_groups` identified by the ID `4`. Note that in reality, node groups and users use UUIDs as their IDs.

```json
{"token": "<subject uuid>",
 "permissions": [{"object_type": "node_groups",
                  "action": "edit_rules",
                  "instance": "4"},
                 {"object_type": "users",
                  "action": "disable",
                  "instance": "1"}]
}
```

### Response format

Returns a 200 OK response with an array of Boolean values representing whether each submitted action on a specific object type and instance is permitted for the subject. The array always has the same length as the submitted array and each returned Boolean value corresponds to the submitted permission query at the same index.

The example response below was returned from the example request in the previous section. This return means the subject is permitted `node_groups:edit_rules:4` but not permitted `users:disable:1`.

```json
[true, false]
```

# Maintenance

-   **[Backing up and restoring Puppet Enterprise](backing_up_and_restoring_pe.md#)**  
Keep regular backups of your PE infrastructure. Backups allow you to more easily migrate to a new master, troubleshoot, and quickly recover in the case of system failures.
-   **[Database maintenance](pe_database_maintenance.md#)**  
You can optimize the Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) databases to improve performance.

# Next steps

After you've worked through the Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) getting started steps, you can now perform the core workflows of a Puppet user.

To continue learning, take the following next steps:

-   Learn more about working with the [Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/) to find the modules you need.
-   Use the [roles and profiles](designing_convenient_roles.md#) method to create a complete system configuration and store it in a control repository.
-   Manage Puppet code using PE [code management](managing_puppet_code.md) tools and a control repository.
-   Classify nodes using [groups and rules](grouping_and_classifying_nodes.md#).

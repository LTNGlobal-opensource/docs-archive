# Environment-based testing

An environment-based testing workflow is an effective approach for testing new code before pushing it to production.

Before testing and promoting data using an environment-based workflow, you must have configured:

-   A test environment that's a child of the production environment
-   Classification node groups that include nodes assigned dynamically or statically

## Test and promote a parameter

Test and promote a parameter when using an environment-based testing workflow.

### Procedure

1.  Create a classification node group with the test environment that is a child of a classification group that uses the production environment.

2.  In the child group, set a test parameter. The test parameter overrides the value set by the parent group using the production environment.

3.  If you're satisfied with your test results, manually change the parameter in the parent group.

4.  \(Optional\) Delete the child test group.


## Test and promote a class

Test and promote a class when using an environment-based testing workflow.

### Procedure

1.  Create a classification node group with the test environment that is a child of a classification group that uses the production environment.

    The node classifier validates your parameters against the test environment.

2.  If you're satisfied with your test results, change the environment for the node group from test to production.


## Testing code with canary nodes using alternate environments

Puppet Enterprise allows you to centrally manage which nodes are in which environments.

In most cases the environments are long-lived, such as development, testing, and production, and nodes don't move between these environments after their initial environment has been set.

When an agent node matches the rules specified in environment node groups, the agent is classified in that environment regardless of any environments specified in the agent's own `puppet.conf` file. Agents can't override this server-specified environment. That's the desired behavior in most cases.

A notable exception is when you want to test new Puppet code before deployment, and you have a code promotion workflow based on environments. In this case, you can specify that certain nodes are allowed to use an agent-specified environment. You map the agent-specified environment to a feature branch in your version control system. This override enables you to quickly test the code in your feature branch without permanently changing the environment that the node is in.

To apply an agent-specified environment for more than one run, specify the environment in the node's `puppet.conf` file. Doing this also sets the `agent_specified_environment` fact to `true`. The node will continue to get the agent-specified environment until you remove the environment from its `puppet.conf` file, or change the rules in the testing environment group.

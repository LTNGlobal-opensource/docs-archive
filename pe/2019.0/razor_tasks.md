# Razor tasks

Razor tasks describe a process or collection of actions that are performed when Razor provisions machines. Tasks can be used to designate an operating system or other software to install, where to get it, and the configuration details for the installation.

**Important:** Razor tasks differ from Puppet tasks, which let you run arbitrary scripts and commands using Puppet. See the orchestrator documentation for information about Puppet tasks.

Tasks consist of a YAML metadata file and any number of ERB templates. Templates are used to generate things like the iPXE script that boots a node into the installer, and automated installation files like kickstart, preseed, or unattended files.

You specify the tasks you want to run in policies.

You can use several sources for tasks:

-   Supported tasks that are included with Razor

-   Copies of supported tasks that you customize as needed

-   Tasks that you create from scratch


## Supported tasks

Razor includes these supported tasks.

|Task|Version|Notes|
|----|-------|:----|
|CentOS|6, 7| |
|coreOS|1|Enables deployment of clusters.|
|Debian|wheezy| |
|microkernel| |System task. Boots the Razor microkernel.|
|noop| |System task. Boots a system locally.|
|Red Hat|6, 7| |
|SUSE Linux Enterprise Server|11, 12| |
|Ubuntu|14.04, 16.04| |
|VMware ESXi|5.5, 6| |
|Windows|2008 R2, 2012 R2, 8 Pro, 2016| |

**Important:** Don't modify supported tasks in place. If you want to customize a supported task, copy the task from the default task directory \(`/opt/puppetlabs/server/apps/razor-server/share/razor-server/tasks`\) to the custom task directory \(`/etc/puppetlabs/razor-server/tasks`\) before modifying the task.

## Storage directories

Tasks are stored in the file system. The `task_path` class parameter of the `pe_razor` module determines where Razor looks for tasks.

The parameter can include a colon-separated list of paths. Relative paths in that list are taken to be relative to the top-level Razor directory. For example, setting `task_path` to `/opt/puppet/share/razor-server/tasks:/home/me/task:tasks` makes Razor search for tasks in these three directories in order.

By default, there are two directories that store tasks:

-   `/opt/puppetlabs/server/apps/razor-server/share/razor-server/tasks` stores default tasks shipped with the product.
-   `/etc/puppetlabs/razor-server/tasks` stores custom tasks.

## Task metadata

Tasks can include the following metadata in the task's YAML file. This file is called `metadata.yaml` and exists in `tasks/<NAME>.task` where `NAME` is the task name. Therefore, the task name looks like this: `tasks/<NAME>.task/metadata.yaml`.

```

description: HUMAN READABLE DESCRIPTION
os: OS NAME
os_version: OS_VERSION_NUMBER
base: TASK_NAME
boot_sequence:
  1: boot_templ1
  2: boot_templ2
  default: boot_local
```

Only `os_version` and `boot_sequence` are required. The `base` key allows you to derive one task from another by reusing some of the `base` metadata and templates. If the derived task has metadata that's different from the metadata in `base`, the derived metadata overrides the base task's metadata.

The `boot_sequence` hash indicates which templates to use when a node using this task boots. In the example above, a node first boots using `boot_templ1`, then using `boot_templ2`. For every subsequent boot, the node uses `boot_local`.

## Task templates

Task templates are ERB templates and are searched in all the directories in the `task_path` configuration setting.

Templates are searched in the subdirectories in this order:

1.  `name.task`
2.  `base.task` if present
3.  `common`

**Template helpers**

Templates can use the following helpers to generate URLs that point back to the server; all of the URLs respond to a `GET` request, even the ones that make changes on the server.

-   `task`: Includes attributes such as `name`, `os`, `os_version`, `boot_seq`, `label`, `description`, `base`, and `architecture`.
-   `node`: Includes attributes such as `name`, `metadata`, and `facts`.

    **Tip:** You can use`node.hw_hash['fact_boot_type'] == "efi"` to evaluate whether a node booted via UEFI.

-   `repo`: Includes attributes such as `name`, `iso_url`, `url`.
-   `file_url(TEMPLATE, RAW)`: The URL that retrieves `TEMPLATE.erb` \(after evaluation\) from the current node's task. By default, the file is interpolated \(`RAW=false`\). If the file doesn't need to be interpolated, specify `RAW=true`.
-   `repo_url(PATH)`: The URL to the file at `PATH` in the current repo.
-   `repo_file_contents(PATH)`: The contents of the file at `PATH` inside the repo. This is an empty string if the file does not exist.
-   `repo_file?(PATH)`: Whether a file exists at the given path. This is `nil` if the file does not exist.
-   `log_url(MESSAGE, SEVERITY)`: The URL that logs `MESSAGE` in the current node's log.
-   `node_url`: The URL for the current node.
-   `store_url(VARS)`: The URL that stores the values in the hash `VARS` in the node. Currently only changing the node's IP address is supported. Use `store_url("ip" => "192.168.0.1")` for that.
-   `stage_done_url`: The URL that tells the server that this stage of the boot sequence is finished, and that the next boot sequence should begin upon reboot.
-   `broker_install_url`: A URL from which the install script for the node's broker can be retrieved. You can see an example in the script, [os\_complete.erb](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/blob/master/tasks/common/os_complete.erb), which is used by most tasks.

Each boot \(except for the default boot\) must culminate in something akin to `curl <%= stage_done_url %>` before the node reboots. Omitting this causes the node to reboot with the same boot template over and over again.

The task must indicate to the Razor server that it has successfully completed by doing a `GET` request against `stage_done_url("finished")`, for example using `curl` or `wget`. This marks the node `installed` in the Razor database.

You use these helpers by causing your script to perform an `HTTP GET` against the generated URL. This might mean that you pass an argument like `ks=<%= file_url("kickstart")%>` when booting a kernel, or that you put `curl <%= log_url("Things work great") %>` in a shell script.

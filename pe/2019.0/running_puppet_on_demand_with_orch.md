# Running Puppet on demand

The orchestrator gives you the ability to set up jobs in the console or on the command line to trigger on-demand Puppet runs.

-   **[Running Puppet on demand from the console](running_puppet_on_demand_in_the_console.md#)**  
When you set up a job to run Puppet from the console, the orchestrator creates a job ID to track the job, shows you all nodes included in the job, and runs Puppet on those nodes in the appropriate order. Puppet compiles a new catalog for each node included in the job.
-   **[Running Puppet on demand from the CLI](running_puppet_on_demand_from_the_cli.md#)**  
Use the **puppet job run** command to enforce change on your agent nodes with on-demand Puppet runs.
-   **[Running Puppet on demand with the API](orchestrator_api_commands_endpoint.md#)**  
Run the orchestrator across all nodes in an environment.

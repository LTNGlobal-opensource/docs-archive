# Use an independent intermediate certificate authority

The built-in Puppet certificate authority automatically generates a root and intermediate certificate, but you can set up an independent intermediate certificate authority during installation if you need additional intermediate certificates, or if you prefer to use a public authority CA.

## Before you begin

You must have a CA chain, a CRL chain, and a private key. Certificate chains must be ordered from least to most authoritative, with the cert for the CA that you intend to use positioned first in the chain files.

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Copy your CA chain, CRL chain, and private key to the node where you're installing the master.

    **Tip:** Allow access to your private key only from the PE installation process, which runs as root.

2.  Follow the instructions to install PE in text mode, adding the `signing_ca` parameter to `pe.conf`.  

    You must include all three key/value pairs for the `signing_ca` parameter: `bundle`, `crl_chain`, and `private_key`. 

    ```
    {
     "pe_install::signing_ca": {
       "bundle": "/root/ca/int_ca_bundle"
       "crl_chain": "/root/ca/int_crl_chain"
       "private_key": "/root/ca/int_key"
     }
    }
    ```

3.  Validate that the CA is working using the standard openssl tools installed with PE.

    ```
    openssl x509 -in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/<HOSTNAME>.crt 
    -text -noout
    Certificate:
       Data:
           Version: 3 (0x2)
           Serial Number: 1 (0x1)
       Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
           Issuer: CN=intermediate-ca
    ...
    
    ```

# Analytics data collection

Some components automatically collect data about how you use Puppet Enterprise. If you want to opt out of providing this data, you can do so, either during or after installing.

If PE is installed using an Amazon Web Services Marketplace Image:

-   The marketplace name
-   Marketplace image billing mode \(bring your own license or pay as you go\)

While in use, the console collects the following information:

-   Pageviews
-   Link and button clicks
-   Page load time
-   User language
-   Screen resolution
-   Viewport size
-   Anonymized IP address

The console *does not* collect user inputs such as node or group names, user names, rules, parameters, or variables

The collected data is tied to a unique, anonymized identifier for each master and your site as a whole. No personally identifiable information is collected, and the data we collect is never used or shared outside Puppet, Inc.

### How does sharing this data benefit you?

We use the data to identify organizations that could be affected by a security issue, alert them to the issue, and provide them with steps to take or fixes to download. In addition, the data helps us understand how people use the product, which helps us improve the product to meet your needs.

### How does Puppet use the collected data?

The data we collect is one of many methods we use for learning about our customers. For example, knowing how many nodes you manage helps us develop more realistic product testing. And learning which operating systems are the most and the least used helps us decide where to prioritize new functionality. By collecting data, we begin to understand you as a customer.

## Opt out during the installation process

To opt out of data collection during installation, you can set the `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` environment variable when you run the installer script. This opt-out method works for all installation methods: express, text, and web-based.

### About this task

Setting the `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` environment variable during installation sets `puppet_enterprise::send_analytics_data: false` in `pe.conf`, opting you out of data collection.

### Procedure

1.  Follow the instructions for your chosen installation method, adding `DISABLE_ANALYTICS=1` when you call the installer script, for example:

    ```
    sudo DISABLE_ANALYTICS=1 ./puppet-enterprise-installer
    ```


## Opt out after installing

If you've already installed PE and want to disable data collection, follow these steps.

### Procedure

1.  In the console, click **Classification**, and then click **PE Infrastructure**.

2.  On the **Configuration** tab, on the `puppet_enterprise` class, add `send_analytics_data` as a parameter and set the **Value** to `false`.

3.  On the **Inventory** page, select your master node and click **Run Puppet**.

4.  Select your console node and click **Run Puppet**.


### Results

After Puppet runs to enforce the changes on the master and console nodes, you have opted out of data collection.

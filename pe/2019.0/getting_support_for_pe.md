# Getting support

You can get commercial support for versions of PE in mainstream and extended support. You can also get support from our user community.

## Puppet Enterprise support life cycle

Some of our releases have long term support \(LTS\); others have short term support \(STS\). For each release, there are three phases of product support: Mainstream support, Extended support, and End of Life \(EOL\).

For full information about types of releases, support phases and dates for each release, frequency of releases, and recommendations for upgrading, see the [Puppet Enterprise support lifecycle](https://puppet.com/misc/puppet-enterprise-lifecycle) page.

If the latest release with the most up-to-date features is right for you, [Download, try, or upgrade Puppet Enterprise](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-enterprise). Alternatively, download an older supported release from [Previous releases](https://puppet.com/misc/pe-files/previous-releases).

### Open source tools and libraries

PE uses open source tools and libraries. We use both externally maintained components \(such as Ruby, PostgreSQL, and the JVM\) and also projects which we own and maintain \(such as Facter, Puppet agent, Puppet Server, and PuppetDB.\)

Projects which we own and maintain are "upstream" of our commercial releases. Our open source projects move faster and have shorter support life cycles than PE. We might discontinue updates to our open source platform components before their commercial EOL dates. We vet upstream security and feature releases and update supported versions according to customer demand and our [Security policy](https://puppet.com/docs/vulnerability-submission-process).

## The customer support portal

We provide responsive, dependable, quality support to resolve any issues regarding the installation, operation, and use of Puppet Enterprise \(PE\).

There are two levels of commercial support plans for PE: Standard and Premium. Both allow you to report your support issues to our confidential [customer support portal](https://support.puppet.com/hc/). When you purchase PE, you receive an account and log-on for the portal, which includes access to our knowledge base.

### Puppet Enterprise support script

When seeking support, you might be asked to run an information-gathering support script. This script collects a large amount of system information, compresses it, and prints the location of the zipped tarball when it finishes running.

The script is provided by the `pe_support_script` module bundled with the installer. Running the command executes a single bash script which can be found at: `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/lib/puppet_x/puppetlabs/support_script/v1/puppet-enterprise-support.sh`

Run the support script on the command line of any PE node running Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating systems with the command: `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet enterprise support`.

Use these options when you run the support script to modify the output:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|`--render-as <FORMAT>`|Specifies what rendering format to use.|
|`--verbose`|Logs verbosely.|
|`--debug`|Logs debug information.|
|`--classifier`|Collects classification data.|
|`--dir <DIRECTORY>`|Specifies where to save the support script's resulting tarball.|
|`--ticket <NUMBER>`|Specifies a support ticket number for record-keeping purposes.|
|`--encrypt`|Encrypts the support script's resulting tarball with GnuPG encryption. **Note:** You must have GPG or GPG2 available in your `PATH` in order to encrypt the tarball.

|
|`--log-age`|Specifies how many days worth of logs the support script collects. Valid values are positive integers or `all` to collect all logs, up to 1 GB per log.|

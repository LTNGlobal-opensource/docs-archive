# Welcome to Puppet Enterprise® 2019.0.4

Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) helps you be productive, agile, and collaborative while managing your IT infrastructure. PE combines a model-driven approach with imperative task execution so you can effectively manage hybrid infrastructure across its entire lifecycle. PE provides the common language that all teams in an IT organization can use to successfully adopt practices such as version control, code review, automated testing, continuous integration, and automated deployment.

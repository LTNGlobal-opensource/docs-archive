## Known issues

#### Known issue: Windows 32-bit agents are not supported

The vRO Puppet plug-in can't manage agents running the 32-bit (x86) version of the Puppet agent. Only 64-bit (x64) agents are supported.

> **Upgrade warning:** The plug-in **does not** support upgrades from the previous vRO Puppet plug-in versions (i.e. 1.0, 2.0). If you're using any previous version of the plug-in, you must [completely remove it](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2064575) before installing. The vRO starter content repository includes [a script to assist with removing the plug-in](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vro-starter_content/blob/production/scripts/remove_plugin.sh).

Welcome to the Puppet Enterprise user's guide!

Puppet Enterprise makes it easy to automate the provisioning, configuration and ongoing management of your machines and the software running on them. Make rapid, repeatable changes and automatically enforce the consistency of systems and devices - across physical and virtual machines, on premise or in the cloud.

+ Reduce cycle times to get more software deployed
+ Make fast, iterative changes
+ Define a configuration once, and apply it to thousands of machines
+ Automatically remediate configuration drift
+ Get detailed insight into hardware and software configurations

If you're using an older version of Puppet Enterprise, you can find [documentation for previous versions here](/pe/index.html).

If you've never used PE before and want to evaluate it, download PE with 10 complimentary licenses and follow the Puppet Enterprise quick start guide for [*nix users](./quick_start.html) or [Windows users](./quick_start_windows_intro.html). This walkthrough will guide you through creating a small proof-of-concept deployment while demonstrating the core features and workflows of PE.

You can download and install Puppet Enterprise on up to 10 nodes at no charge, and no license key is needed. Read more about the PE license key on the [Installing the license key page](./install_license_key.html).

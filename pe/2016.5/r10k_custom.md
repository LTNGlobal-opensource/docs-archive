If you need a customized r10k configuration, set parameters for the `pe_r10k` class [in Hiera][hiera].
 
To set these parameters, add keys to your control repository hierarchy in the `hieradata/common.yaml` file in the format `pe_r10k::<parameter>`. For example:

```
pe_r10k::cachedir: /var/cache/r10k
pe_r10k::remote: git://git-server.site/my-org/main-modules
```

> Warning: Do not edit r10kâ€™s configuration file manually. Puppet manages this configuration automatically and will undo any manual changes you make.

## Parameters

### `cachedir`

Specifies the path to the directory where you want the cache of your Git repos to be stored.

Accepts a string, such as `/var/cache/r10k`.

### `deploy` 

The `deploy` setting controls how r10k code deployments behave. The following `deploy` settings are available.

#### purge_levels

The `purge_levels` setting controls which unmanaged content r10k purges during a deployment. This setting accepts an array of the following strings specifying purge levels: 'deployment', 'environment', and 'puppetfile'.

```yaml
 deploy:
  purge_levels: [ 'deployment', 'environment', 'puppetfile' ]
```

This setting affects only the `deploy environment` action.

The default value is `['deployment', 'puppetfile']` to maintain parity with existing behavior.

The purge levels work as follows:

##### deployment

After each deployment, in the configured basedir, r10k recursively removes content that is not managed by any of the sources declared in [`remote`](./r10k_custom.html#remote) or [`sources`](./r10k_custom.html#sources). Note that disabling this level of purging could cause the number of deployed environments to grow without bound, because deleting branches from a control repo would no longer cause the matching environment to be purged.

##### environment

After a given environment is deployed, r10k recursively removes content that is neither committed to the control repo branch that maps to that environment, nor declared in a Puppetfile committed to that branch.

With this purge level, r10k loads and parses the Puppetfile for the environment even if the `--puppetfile` flag is not set. However, Puppetfile content is deployed only if the environment is new or the `--puppetfile` flag is set. Additionally, if an error is encountered while evaluating the Puppetfile or deploying its contents, no environment-level content is purged.

Note that the .r10k-deploy.json file is exempt from this purging.

##### puppetfile

After Puppetfile content for a given environment is deployed, r10k recursively removes content in any directory managed by the Puppetfile if that content is not also declared in that Puppetfile. Directories considered to be managed by a Puppetfile include the configured `moduledir` (which defaults to "modules"), as well as alternate directories specified as an `install_path` option to any Puppetfile content declarations.

#### purge_whitelist

The `purge_whitelist` setting exempts the specified filename patterns from being purged. This setting affects [`environment` level](#environment) purging only. Any given value must be a list of shell style filename patterns in string format.

See the Ruby [documentation for the `fnmatch` method](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/File.html#method-c-fnmatch) for more details on valid patterns. Note that the `FNM_PATHNAME` and `FNM_DOTMATCH` flags are in effect when r10k considers the whitelist.

Patterns are relative to the root of the environment being purged and, by default, *do not match recursively*. For example, a whitelist value of `*myfile*` would preserve only a matching file at the root of the environment. To preserve the file throughout the deployed environment, you would need to use a recursive pattern such as `**/*myfile*`.

Files matching a whitelist pattern might still be removed if they exist in a folder that is otherwise subject to purging. In this case, use an additional whitelist rule to preserve the containing folder.

```yaml
deploy:
  purge_whitelist: [ 'custom.json', '**/*.xpp' ]
```
 
#### write_lock

The `write_lock` setting allows you to temporarily disallow r10k code deploys without completely removing the r10k configuration. This can be useful to prevent r10k deploys at certain times or to prevent r10k from interfering with a common set of code that might be touched by multiple r10k configurations. 

```yaml
deploy:
  write_lock: "Deploying code is disallowed until the next maintenance window (2038-01-19)"
```

### `forge_settings`

Contains settings for downloading modules from the Puppet Forge. Accepts a hash of the following values:

#### baseurl

Indicates where Forge modules should be installed from. Defaults to `https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com`.

``` yaml
pe_r10k::forge_settings:
  baseurl: 'https://private-forge.mysite'
```

#### proxy

Sets or overrides the global proxy setting for all Forge interactions. See the global `proxy` setting below for more information and examples.

### `git_settings`

Contains Git-specific settings. Accepts a hash of values, such as:

```yaml
pe_r10k::git_settings:
  provider: "rugged"
  private_key: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa"
  username: "git"
```
You can specify the following in `git_settings`:

#### provider

Specifies what Git provider to use. You can use one of two providers for r10k: rugged and shellgit.

We recommend the Rugged provider, which is also the only supported provider for configuring r10k with `pe.conf` or the master profile. Rugged requires Ruby 1.9 or greater.

However, existing r10k installations and customized configurations default to the shellgit provider. If you are using shellgit, [install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on both your Puppet master and on the Puppet code development machine.

#### private_key

Required, but can be supplied by the master profile. Specifies the file containing the default private key used to access control repositories, such as `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa`. This file must have read permissions for the `pe-puppet` user. The SSH key cannot require a password.

#### proxy

Sets or overrides the global proxy setting specifically for Git operations that use an HTTP(S) transport. See the global `proxy` setting below for more information and examples.

#### repositories

A list of repositories and their respective private keys. Use this setting if you want to use multiple control repos. To use multiple control repos, the `sources` setting and the `repositories` setting must match.

  * `remote`: The repository these settings should apply to.
  * `private_key`: The file containing the private key to use for this repository. This file must have read permissions for the `pe-puppet` user. This setting overrides the global `private_key` setting.
  * `proxy`: The `proxy` setting allows you to set or override the global proxy setting for a single, specific repository. See the global `proxy` setting below for more information and examples.

  
This setting accepts an array of hashes in the following format:
  
```yaml
pe_r10k::git_settings:
  repositories:
    - remote: "ssh://tessier-ashpool.freeside/protected-repo.git"
      private_key: "/etc/puppetlabs/r10k/ssh/id_rsa-protected-repo-deploy-key"
    - remote: "https://git.example.com/my-repo.git"
      proxy: "https://proxy.example.com:3128"
```

#### username

Optionally, specify a username when the Git remote URL does not provide a username. 

### `proxy`

Configures a proxy server to use for all operations that occur over an HTTP(S) transport. To override this setting for Git or Forge operations only, set the `proxy` parameter under [`git_settings`](#gitsettings) or [`forge_settings`](#forgesettings). To override for a specific Git repository, set a proxy in the `repositories` list of `git_settings`. To override this setting with no proxy for Git, Forge, or a particular repository, set that specific `proxy` setting to an empty string.

By default, r10k looks for and uses the first environment variable it finds in this list: HTTPS_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy. If no proxy setting is found in the environment, this setting defaults to use no proxy.

```yaml
proxy: 'http://proxy.example.com:3128'
```

r10k also supports authenticated proxies with either Basic or Digest authentication:

```yaml
proxy: 'http://user:password@proxy.example.com:3128'
```

The proxy server used is logged at the "debug" level when r10k runs.


### `postrun`

An optional command to be run after r10k finishes deploying environments. The command must be an array of strings to be used as an argument vector.

```yaml
  - "/usr/bin/curl"
  - "-F"
  - "deploy=done"
  - "http://my-app.site/endpoint"
```


  
### `remote`

Specifies where the source repository should be fetched from. The remote must be able to be fetched without any interactive input. That is, you cannot be prompted for usernames or passwords in order to fetch the remote. If `remote` is set, you cannot use `sources`.

Accepts a string that is any valid SSH URL that r10k can clone, such as: 

`git://git-server.site/my-org/main-modules`


### `r10k_basedir`

Specifies the path where environments will be created for this source. This directory is entirely managed by r10k, and any contents that r10k did not put there will be removed. If `r10k_basedir` is not set, it uses the default `environmentpath` in your `puppet.conf` file. If `r10k_basedir` is set, you cannot set the `sources` parameter.

Note that the `r10k_basedir` setting **must match** the `environmentpath` in your puppet.conf file, or Puppet won't be able to access your new directory environments.

Accepts a string, such as: `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments`.

### `sources` 

This setting is used if you are managing more than just Puppet environments, such as when you are also managing Hiera data in its own control repository. Note that if `sources` is set, you cannot use the `remote` and `r10k_basedir` settings above.

The `sources` setting can include the following subsettings:

* [remote](#remote)
* [basedir](#basedir)
* [prefix](#prefix)
* [invalid_branches](#invalidbranches)

This setting accepts a hash such as:

```yaml
myorg: 
  remote: "git://git-server.site/myorg/main-modules"
  basedir: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments"
  prefix: true
mysource: 
  remote: "git://git-server.site/mysource/main-modules"
  basedir: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments"
  prefix: "testing"
```

Note that r10k raises an error if different sources collide in a single base directory. If you are using multiple sources, use the [prefix](#prefix) option to prevent collisions.

#### remote

Specifies where the source repository should be fetched from. The remote must be able to be fetched without any interactive input. That is, you cannot be prompted for usernames or passwords in order to fetch the remote.

Accepts a string that is any valid URL that r10k can clone, such as: 

`git://git-server.site/my-org/main-modules`

#### basedir

Specifies the path where environments will be created for this source. This directory is entirely managed by r10k, and any contents that r10k did not put there will be removed.

Note that the `basedir` setting **must match** the `environmentpath` in your puppet.conf file, or Puppet won't be able to access your new directory environments.

#### prefix

Allows environment names to be prefixed with this string. Alternatively, if `prefix` is set to true, the source's name will be used. This prevents collisions when multiple sources are deployed into the same directory.

In the `sources` example above, two "main-modules" environments are set up in the same base directory. The prefix setting is used to differentiate the environments: the first will be named "myorg-main-modules", and the second will be "testing-main-modules".

#### invalid_branches

Specifies how branch names that cannot be cleanly mapped to Puppet environments are handled. This option accepts three values:

* 'correct_and_warn' is the default value and replaces non-word characters with underscores and issues a warning.
* 'correct' replaces non-word characters with underscores without warning.
* 'error' ignores branches with non-word characters and issues an error.

```yaml
mysource: 
  basedir: "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments"
  invalid_branches: "error"
  remote: "git://git-server.site/mysource/main-modules"
```


## Next steps

Next, [run r10k][run] to deploy your environments. PE does not automatically run r10k at the end of installation.
